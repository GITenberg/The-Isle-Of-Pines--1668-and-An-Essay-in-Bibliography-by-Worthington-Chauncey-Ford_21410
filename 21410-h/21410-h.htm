      PREFATORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      My curiosity on the "Isle of Pines" was aroused by the sale of a copy in
      London and New York in 1917, and was increased by the discovery of two
      distinct issues in the Dowse Library, in the Massachusetts Historical
      Society. As my material grew in bulk and the history of this hoax
      perpetrated in the seventeenth century developed, I thought it of
      sufficient interest to communicate an outline of the story to the Club of
      Odd Volumes, of Boston, October 23, 1918. The results of my investigations
      are more fully given in the present volume. I acknowledge my indebtedness
      to the essay of Max Hippe, "Eine vor-De-foesche Englische Robinsonade,"
      published in Eugen Kölbing's "Englische Studien" xix. 66.

    <h2>
      THE ISLE OF PINES
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p003.png">[3]</a></span>The scene
      opens in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the year 1668, where in one of the
      college buildings a contest between two rival printers had been waged for
      some years. Marmaduke Johnson, a trained and experienced printer, to whose
      ability the Indian Bible is largely due, had ceased to be the printer of
      the corporation, or Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New
      England, but still had a press and, what was better, a fresh outfit of
      type, sent over by the corporation and entrusted to the keeping of John
      Eliot, the Apostle. Samuel Green had become a printer, though without
      previous training, and was at this time printer to the college, a position
      of vantage against a rival, because it must have carried with it
      countenance from the authorities in Boston, and public printing then as
      now constituted an item to a press of some income and some perquisites. By
      seeking to marry Green's daughter before his English wife had ceased to
      be, Johnson had created a prejudice, public as well as private, against
      himself.{1}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Mass. Hist Soc. Proceedings, xx. 265.
</pre>
    <p>
      Each wished to set up a press in Boston itself, but the General Court,
      probably for police reasons, had ordered that there should be no printing
      but at Cambridge, and that what was printed there should be approved by
      any two of four gentlemen appointed by the Court. It thus appeared that
      each printer possessed a certain superiority over his rival. In the matter
      of types Johnson was favored, as he had new types and was a trained
      printer; but these advantages were partially <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p004.png">[4]</a></span>neutralized by indolence and by
      Green's better standing before the magistrates.{1}
    </p>
    <p>
      In England the excesses of the printing-press during the civil war and
      commonwealth led to a somewhat strict though erratically applied
      censorship under the restoration. A publication must be licensed, and the
      Company of Stationers still sought, for reasons of profit, to control
      printers by regulating their production. The licensing agent in chief was
      a character of picturesque uncertainty and spasmodic action, Roger
      L'Estrange, half fanatic, half politician, half hack writer, in fact half
      in many respects and whole only in the resulting contradictions of purpose
      and performance. On one point he was strong&mdash;a desire to suppress
      unlicensed printing. So when in 1668 warrant was given to him to make
      search for unauthorized printing, he entered into the hunt with the zeal
      of a Loyola and the wishes of a Torquemada, harrying and rushing his prey
      and breathing threats of extreme rigor of fine, prison, pillory, and stake
      against the unfortunates who had neglected, in most cases because of the
      cost, to obtain the stamp of the licenser.{2}
    </p>
    <p>
      New England was at this time England in little, with troubles of its own;
      but, having imitated the mother country in introducing supervision of the
      press, it also started in to investigate the printers of the colony, two
      in number, seeking to win a smile of approval from the foolish man on the
      throne. With due solemnity the inquisition was <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p005.png">[5]</a></span>made. Green could show that all
      then passing through his press had been properly licensed.
    </p>

     P., Dom. 1663-1664, 616</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Johnson, less fortunate, was caught with one unlicensed piece&mdash;"The
      Isle of Pines." A fine of five pounds was imposed upon him, as effectual
      in suppressing him as though it had been one of five thousand pounds. He
      could now turn with relish to two books then on his press, "Meditations on
      Death and Eternity" and the "Righteous Man's Evidence for Heaven;" for
      Massachusetts Bay, with its then powerful rule of divinity without
      religion, or religion without mercy, held out small hope of his meeting
      such a fine within the expedition of his natural life. But he made his
      submission, petitioned the General Court in properly repentant language,
      acknowledged his fault, his crime, and promised amendment{1} The fine was
      not collected, and the principal result of the incident was to further the
      very natural union of Johnson and Green, but with Johnson as the lesser
      member in importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      No copy of Marmaduke Johnson's issue of the "Isle of Pines" has come to
      light in a period of 248 years. It might well be supposed that the
      authorities caught him before the tract had gone to press, and so snuffed
      it out completely. Our sapient bibliographers have dismissed the matter in
      rounded phrase: "'The Isle of Pines' was a small pamphlet of the Baron
      Munchausen order, which in its day passed through several editions in
      England and on the Continent,"{2} a description which would fit a hundred
      titles of the period. In July, 1917, Sotheby announced the sale of a
      portion of the Americana collected by <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p006.png">[6]</a></span>"Bishop White Kennett (1660-1728)
      and given by him to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
      Foreign Parts."

    <p>
      Lot No. 113 was described as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      [Neville (Henry)] The Isle of Pines, or a late Discovery of a fourth
      Island in Terra Australis, Incognita, being a True Relation of certain
      English persons who in the dayes of Queen Elizabeth, making a Voyage to
      the East Indies, were cast away and wracked upon the Island, <i>wanting
      the frontispiece, head-line of title and some pagination cut into, Bishop
      Kenneths signature on title. sm. 4to S. G. for Allen Banks, 1668</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pamphlet was sold, I am told, for fourteen shillings,{1} and resold
      shortly after to a New York bookseller for fifty-five dollars. He was
      attracted by the imprint, which read in full, "London, by <i>S. G.</i> for
      <i>Allen Banks</i> and <i>Charles Harper</i> at the <i>Flower-Deluice</i>
      near <i>Cripplegate</i> Church." The general appearance of the pamphlet
      was unlike even the moderately good issues of the English press, and the
      "by S. G." not only did not answer to any London printer of the day,
      except Sarah Griffin, "a printer in the Old Bailey,"{2} but was in form
      and usage exactly what could be found on a number of the issues of the
      press of Samuel Green, of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The sale took place July 30, 1917.

     2  Only once does her name occur in the <i>Term Catalogues</i>,
     when in February, 1673, the prints George Buchanan'
     <i>Psalmorum Davidis Paraphrasis Poetica</i>, which told for two
     shillings a copy. Samuel Gellibrand was not a printer but a
     bookseller, with a shop "at the Ball in St. Paul's
     Churchyard."
</pre>
    <p>
      On comparing the first page of the text of his purchase with the same page
      of an acknowledged London issue of the "Isle of Pines" <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p007.png">[7]</a></span>in the John
      Carter Brown Library,{1} the bookseller concluded that the two were
      entirely different publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expert cataloguer connected with one of the large auction firms of New
      York then took up the subject. After a study of the tract he became
      assured that it could only have been printed by Samuel Green, of
      Cambridge, and he brought forward facts and comparisons which seemed
      conclusive and for which he deserves much credit. It was a clever bit of
      bibliographical work. With such an endorsement as to rarity and quality
      the pamphlet was again put to the test of the auction room. The cataloguer
      stated his case in sufficient fulness of detail and the first page of the
      text was reproduced.{2} Naturally the discovery sent a little thrill
      through the mad-house of bibliography. The tract was knocked down for $400
      to a bookseller from Hartford, Connecticut, presumably for some local
      collection. The incident would have passed from memory had it not been for
      one of those accidents to which even the amateur bibliographer is liable.

      In the bitter days of the winter of 1917-18 the working force of the
      Massachusetts Historical Society was contracted into one room&mdash;the
      Dowse Library&mdash;where was at least a semblance <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p008.png">[8]</a></span>of warmth in the open fireplace.

    <h2>
      THE DOWSE COPIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      One afternoon, when I had finished my work and the others had left, I
      picked up the catalogue of the Dowse Library and began idly to turn over
      its leaves. Incidentally, that catalogue is characteristic of the older
      methods of the Society. As is known to the elect, no book in the Dowse
      Library can ever leave the room in which it now rests, and of the
      catalogue twenty-five copies were printed and never circulated. If the
      library had been left in the Dowse house in Cambridgeport, its existence
      and contents could not have been more successfully hidden from the world.
      While reading the titles in a very casual way, my eye was caught by one
      which gave me a start. It read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sloetten (Cornelius van). The Isle of Pines; or a Late Discovery of a
      Fourth Island in Terra Australis Incognita. London, printed by G. S. for
      Allen Banks, 1668. With a New and Further Discovery of the Isle of Pines,
      1668; and a duplicate of the Isle of Pines. 1 vol. small 4to, calf supr.,
      gilt leaves. A most interesting, rare, and valuable work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even against the Editor of the Society the Dowse books are kept behind
      lock and key, though he is not under more than ordinary suspicion. So I
      was obliged to wait till the next day before my curiosity could be
      satisfied. I then found a thin volume, less than one-third of an inch in
      thickness, containing two copies of this very tract which the auction
      expert had identified as an issue of the "Isle of Pines" by Green, and a
      London issue of a second part of the "Isle of Pines," with the name of
      Cornelius Van Sloetten, as author. For more than fifty years this little
      volume had reposed in this well-known yet almost forgotten <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p009.png">[9]</a></span>library, and no
      one had suspected or questioned the nature of its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full fifty years it had been in the care and at the call of Dr. Samuel
      A. Green, who claimed to be an expert on New England imprints of the
      seventeenth century, and one of the great wishes of whose life had been to
      establish his descent from this very printer, Samuel Green. Two copies
      within the same covers, of a tract long sought and of which only a single
      example had come to light in two centuries and a half&mdash;was not that
      alone something of a bibliographical coup?
    </p>
    <p>
      I read two of the pieces&mdash;one of the Green issues and the second part
      as printed in England&mdash;making a few notes for future use. On
      returning to the matter some weeks later I found to my annoyance that
      every reference to the Green tract but one was wrong as to the page. Cold,
      haste, or weariness will account for a single or possibly two errors of
      reference, but to have a whole series&mdash;except one&mdash;go wrong
      pointed to failing eyes or mind. Very much put out, I read the tract a
      second time and corrected the page references, carefully checking up the
      result. Some days after I again took up the matter, and in verifying my
      first quotation found that I had again put down the wrong page number, and
      was surprised to find that the correct page was the one I had first given.
      This proved to be the case in all the references&mdash;except one. A book
      which could thus change its page numbering from week to week was bewitched&mdash;or
      I was careless. It occurred to me to compare the two copies of the tract
      as published by Green. The title-pages were exactly alike&mdash;not
      differing by so much as a fly speck, but one copy contained ten pages of
      text and the other only nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      More <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p010.png">[10]</a></span>than
      that, the general style and the types were quite different One was printed
      in a well-known broad but somewhat used type, such as could be seen in
      Green's printing, and the other in a finer font with much italic. There
      was no possibility of confusing the two issues. Only one conclusion was
      possible. I had in this volume the publication by Green, and the original
      issue by Marmaduke Johnson, but with Green's title-page. So for we seem to
      rest upon solid ground. It may be surmised that Green set up his "Isle of
      Pines" in rivalry to Johnson, but did not incur the discipline of the
      authorities; or that he had set it up and also took over Johnson's
      edition, using his own title-page; and in either case it is possible that
      a simple subterfuge, the imprint, "by S. G. for Allen Banks and Charles
      Harper," a London combination of publishers, caused the tract to escape
      the attention of the examining local censors. Here was another step in
      developing the history of this tract&mdash;the discovery of one of
      Johnson's issues, except for the title-page. So far as the American
      connection is concerned, it only remains to discover a Johnson issue with
      a Johnson title-page, for in his apology and submission to the General
      Court he states that he had "affixed" his name to the pamphlet.

      THE EUROPEAN EDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The European connection is also not without interest, for the skit&mdash;the
      first part of the "Isle of Pines," published without name of author&mdash;had
      an extraordinary run.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1493 a little <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p011.png">[11]</a></span>four-leaved
      translation into Latin of a Columbus letter announcing the discovery of
      islands in the west&mdash;De insulis nuper inventis&mdash;ran over Europe,
      startling the age by a simple relation which proved a marvellous tale as
      taken up by Vespuccius, Cortes, and a host of successors.{1} For a century
      the darkness of a new found continent slowly lifted and the record was
      collected in Ramusio, in De Bry, in Hulsius, and in Hakluyt, never felling
      treasuries of the wonderful, veritable schools for the adventurous.
      Another century had shown that, so fer from decreasing in greatness and in
      opportunities, the field of discovery had not begun to be tested, and in
      the summer of 1668 a new island&mdash;the Isle of Pines&mdash;was flashed
      before the London crowd, and proved that the flame of quest with danger
      was still burning. A new island! The interest was international, for
      nations had already long fought over the old discovered lands.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The intelligent industry of Mr. Wilberforce Eames has
     identified eleven issues of the letter of Columbus, printed
     in 1493, in Barcelona, Rome, Basle, Paris, and Antwerp; and
     twelve issues of the <i>Novus Mundus</i> of Vespucci us, printed
     in 1504, in Augsburg, Paris, Nuremberg, Cologne, Antwerp,
     and Venice. An earlier and even more extraordinary
     distribution of a letter of news is that of the letter
     purporting to be addressed by Prester John to the Emperor
     Manuel, which circulated through Europe about 1165. "How
     great was the popularity and diffusion of this letter,"
     writes Sir Henry Yule, "may be judged in some degree from
     the fad that Zarncke in his treatise on Prester John gives a
     list of close on 100 mss. of it Of these there are eight in
     the British Museum, ten at Vienna, thirteen in the great
     Paris Library, and fifteen at Munich. There are also several
     renderings in old German verse." The cause of this
     popularity was the hope offered by the reported exploits of
     Prester John of a counterpoise to the Mohammedan power.

    <p>
      An even greater contest was being waged for commerce, and with the
      experience of Spain in gathering the precious metals <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p012.png">[12]</a></span>from new found lands, every
      discovery of hitherto uncharted territory opened the possibility of wealth
      and an exchange of commodities, if rapine and piracy could not be
      practised. The merchant was an adventurer, and politics, quite as much as
      trade, controlled his movements; for the line between trader, buccaneer,
      and pirate faded away before conditions which made treaties of no
      importance and peaceful relations dependent upon an absence of the hope of
      gain. A state of war was not necessary to prepare the way for attack and
      plunder in those far distant oceans, and the merchantman sailed armed and
      ready to inflict as well as to repel aggression, only too willing to
      descend upon a weaker vessel or a helpless settlement of a power which had
      come to be regarded as a "natural enemy." So in Holland and in Germany the
      leaflets containing the story of the Isle of Pines were received with
      mingled feelings, exciting a desire to share in the possible benefits to
      be gained or extorted from natives of the new lands, or from those who had
      the first opportunity to exploit a virgin territory. On the first receipt
      of those leaflets merchants held back their vessels about to sail, to
      await more definite information on this fourth island of the Terra
      Australis incognita.

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p013.png">[13]</a></span>An
      examination of the known issues of the tract proves this interest and
      offers an almost unique study in bibliography; for I doubt if any
      publication made in the second half of the seventeenth century&mdash;even
      a state paper of importance, as a treaty&mdash;attained such speedy and
      widespread recognition. A list of the various issues will be found in an
      appendix: it only remains to call attention to a few of the many novelties
      and variant characteristics of the editions.

      DUTCH EDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In June and July, 1668, four tracts on the Isle of Pines from the same pen
      were licensed and published in London, which may for convenience be
      designated the first and second parts of the narrative, and the two parts
      in continuation. From London the tract soon passed to Holland, which had
      ever been a greedy consumer of voyages of discovery, for the greatness of
      that nation depended upon the sea, at once its most potent enemy and
      friend.{1} Three Dutch editions have been found, the earliest in point of
      time being that made by Jacob Vinckel, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p014.png">[14]</a></span>of Amsterdam.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Holland was the centre of map publication as the twenty
     yean before 1668 saw the issue of atlases by Jansson, Blaeu,
     Mercator, Doncker, Cellarius, Loon, Visscher, and Goos, all
     published at Amsterdam. Phillips' list for this period gives
     atlases published elsewhere&mdash;those of Boissevin (Paris,
     1653), Lubin (Paris, 1659), Nicolosi (Rome, 1660), Dudley
     (Florence, 1661), Du Val (Paris, 1662), Jollain (Paris
     1667), Cluver (Wolfen-bûttel, 1667?) and Ortelius (Venice,
     1667).

      His second title is an exact translation of the second title of the London
      first part. This version, however, omitted an essential part of the
      relation. The London second title is also that of the issue made at
      Amsterdam by Jacob Stichter, being the Vinckel version, word for word, and
      almost line for line, but the type used is the gothic, and the spelling of
      words is not the same. Further, Stichter was possessed of some imagination
      and decorated his title-page with a map of a part of the island, showing
      ranges of hills, a harbor or mouth of a river, with conventional
      soundings, and two towns or settlements. As each of these issues contains
      only eight pages of text, the first London part only was known to the
      publishers. The third Dutch edition was put out by Joannes Naeranus, at
      Rotterdam, and in a foreword he gives the following reason for issuing the
      tract:

      To the Reader A part of the present relation is also printed by Jacob
      Vinckel at Amsterdam, being defective in omitting one of the principal
      things, so do we give here a true copy which was sent to us
      authoritatively out of England, but in that language, in order that the
      curious reader may not be deceived by the poor translation, and for that
      reason this very astonishing history fall under suspicion. Lastly, admire
      God's wondrous guidance, and farewell.

    <p>
      His publication contains twenty pages of text, and is not an accurate
      translation of the English tract in parts, but rather a paraphrase of the
      text. To make the confusion the greater, he <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p015.png">[15]</a></span>expressly states on the title-page
      that he used a copy received from London, and gives the London imprint
      which will fit only the first London part. For "by S. G." appears only on
      the title-page of that part.

    <h2>
      FRENCH EDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Amsterdam and under date July 19, 1668, a summary of the earlier
      Dutch issue with two paragraphs of introduction was sent to Paris, and was
      printed in a four-page pamphlet by Sébastien Marbre Cramoisy, the king's
      printer, whose name is so honorably connected with the Jesuit Relations&mdash;stories
      as remarkable as any offered in the "Isle of Pines" and of immeasurable
      value on the earliest years of recorded history in our New England. Even
      this summary, thus definitely dated, offers problems. The location of the
      island is given in general terms in the half-title as "below the
      equinoctial line," and in the text as in "xxviii or xxix degrees of
      Antartique latitude." Nowhere in the first London part is either location
      used, and in the second London part, which bears nearly the same date as
      the Cramoisy summary&mdash;July 22&mdash;twenty degrees of latitude is
      given. The writer of the summary thus allowed himself some freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second French edition, without imprint, contains eleven pages and is a
      translation of the first London part, paraphrased in sentences, but on the
      whole a close rendering of the English text There never was a title-page
      to this issue&mdash;the first page having the signature-mark A&mdash;yet
      with eleven pages only, it <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p016.png">[16]</a></span>would seem fit that a title-page
      should round out the twelve for the convenience of printing.

    <h2>
      ITALIAN EDITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Italian issue, made by Giacomo Didini, in Bologna and Venice, is a
      literal translation of Cramoisy's publication, and bears the same date, at
      Amsterdam, July 19, 1668. The original probably came from Paris, though it
      is possible that some Dutch merchant in Amsterdam sent a circular letter
      on the discovered Isle to his correspondents in Paris and Venice. It is
      unsafe to conjecture in such matters, for an Amsterdam issue may yet be
      found which will give, word for word, the French and Italian versions. Our
      ignorance on the press of the continent of those times, and especially the
      want of files of "corantos," or news sheets, close a wide field of
      research to the American inquirer. The catalogue of the British Museum
      gives 1669 as the probable year of issue. I see no good reason for
      rejecting 1668 as the more probable year. If the tract could go from
      London to Cambridge, in New England, in three months, it could pass from
      Amsterdam to Italy, by land or by sea, in an equal time.

    <h2>
      GERMAN EDITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Holland the relation also penetrated the German states, finding ready
      welcome and arousing eager curiosity. Hippe regards the tract issued by
      Wilhelm Serlin, at Frankfort on the Main, as the first of the German
      publications, and, being translated <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p017.png">[17]</a></span>from the Dutch, he shows that the
      translator used both the Amsterdam and the Rotterdam publications.{1} The
      Hamburg version claimed to be derived from the English original, but it
      followed closely the Serlin translation from the Dutch with modifications
      which might have been drawn from the London tract. An edition not
      mentioned by Hippe or identified by any bibliographer is in the John
      Carter Brown Library, and opens with the statement that it is translated
      from the English and not from the Dutch. It closely follows the text of
      the London first part. Very likely it is the edition found at Copenhagen,
      if the similarity of titles offers an indication of the contents. South
      Germany obtained its information from France, and while neither of the two
      issues avowedly translated from the French gives the place of publication,
      the fact that one is in Munich and the other in Strassburg offers some
      reason to conjecture that they came from the presses of those cities. The
      Munich issue is for the most part a summary of what was in the first
      London issue, and, if translated directly from a French version, must have
      been from one not now located, for it is different from those in the list
      in this volume. Of the Strassburg text, Hippe states that it follows the
      Rotterdam pamphlet Finally, at Breslau is what calls itself a complete
      publication of the combined parts from a copy obtained from London, but it
      is more probably based upon the Dutch translations printed in Amsterdam
      and Rotterdam, with additions drawn from the English.{2}

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p018.png">[18]</a></span>One of
      the strangest uses made of the narrative of Pine is to be found in
      Schoeben's translation into German of Jan Mocquet's "Voyages en Africque,"
      etc., a work of some estimation which had already twice been published in
      France and once in a Dutch translation before Schoeben printed his edition
      in 1688. As pages inserted quite arbitrarily in Mocquets compilation,
      Schoeben gave Pine's story in full, with a paragraph of introduction which
      not a little abuses the truth while giving an additional color of truth.
      He asserted that while kept at Lisbon by the Dutch blockade, he was thrown
      much in the company of an Englishman, one of the Pine family, who were all
      regarded as notable seamen. From this man, then awaiting an opportunity to
      sail for the West Indies, our author heard a very strange story of the
      origin of the Pines, a story then quite notorious at Lisbon. Then follows,
      with some embroidery, a version of the Neville pamphlet, which is not like
      any German translation seen by me, but so full as to extend over ten pages
      of the volume. It ends with a reiteration of the wholly false manner in
      which this story had been obtained. So bold an appropriation of the
      narrative, with a provenience entirely new and as fictitious as the story
      itself, and its bodily inclusion by an editor in a work of recognized
      merit, where it is between two true recitals, cannot be defended.{1}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Mocquet's work originally appeared in Rouen in 1645, and a
     Dutch translation was published at Dordrecht in 1656. A
     second French issue, apparently unchanged in text, was put
     out at Rouen in 1665, and in 1618 Schoeben's edition,
     printed at Lûneberg by Johann Georg Lippers, preceded by
     eight years an English translation made by Nathaniel Pullen.
     The Pine tract appears, of course, only in Schoeben's
     volume.
</pre>
    <p>
      The tract passed to Cambridge, Massachusetts, before or early in
      September, and it would indeed be interesting to know <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p019.png">[19]</a></span>how and through whose hands it
      passed before reaching Marmaduke Johnson&mdash;to his undoing. Hezekiah
      Usher was the only bookseller in Boston at the time, and possibly his son,
      John, may have been associated with him. They ordered what they desired
      from London booksellers and publishers, and may have received voluntary
      consignments of publications from London. That would be a somewhat
      precarious venture, for nothing could be more different than the reading
      markets in Boston and in London, especially in the lighter products of the
      press. Had it come through the Ushers, the title-page might state that it
      had been printed "by M. J. for Hezekiah Usher," but in that event Usher
      would have suffered for not obtaining the needed license. The probability
      is that Johnson was alone responsible and was tempted by the hope of gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were all contemporary issues, coming from the press within six
      months of the first appearance of the tract in London. So startling a
      popularity, so widely shown, was a tribute to the opportunity rather than
      to the contents of the piece. And the European interest continued for a
      full century. In Germany it was included in a number of collections of
      voyages, in Denmark it was printed in 1710 and 1789, and in France Abbé
      Prévost took it for his compilation of 1767 on discoveries. The English
      republication of 1778 has peculiar interest, for it was due to no other
      than Thomas Hollis, the benefactor of the library of Harvard College, who
      saw more in the tract than can now be recognized, and induced Cadell to
      reprint it.

    <h2>
      THE S.G. NOT A CAMBRIDGE IMPRINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the absence of any positive objection, the conclusion of the auction
      expert&mdash;that the S. G. imprint was one of Samuel Green of Cambridge,
      Massachusetts&mdash;remained unquestioned. But a study of editions and of
      the chronological sequence of the English issues offers a decided negative
      to such a conclusion. The first part was licensed June 27, 1668. Van
      Sloetten dated the second part July 22, 1668, and the issue of the
      combined parts was licensed five days later, July 27. In the space of just
      four weeks all three trads were licensed, and the actual publication must
      have occurred within the same period of time. Such had been the start
      obtained by the first part that on the continent it was used for reprint
      and translation, almost to the neglect of the second part, and, as we have
      seen, most of these translations appeared before the end of 1668. Now the
      tract was not known in Massachusetts until discovered by the inquest on
      printers in September, and a S. G. or Samuel Green edition could hardly
      have come from the press before October, even if not delayed by the
      proceedings against Johnson. Yet on die title-page of the Dutch
      translation issued at Rotterdam in 1668, the printer states at length that
      it is from a copy from London, by S. G. for Allen Banks and Charles
      Harper, in the Lily near Cripplegate Church, and in his note "To the
      Reader" he expressly repeats that he obtained a copy of the work from
      London, in order to correct a faulty issue by another Dutch printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If S. G. was Samuel Green, we must suppose that one of his Cambridge
      issues was shipped to Rotterdam in time to <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p021.png">[21]</a></span>be translated and reprinted before
      the end of the year. In point of time the thing could be done, but in
      point of probability it was impossible. Apart from his own statement,
      there were a thousand to one chances in favor of the Dutch printer
      obtaining the pamphlet from London; there were ten thousand chances to one
      against his getting it from Massachusetts. I reject the supposition that
      this was a Cambridge imprint for that reason alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional evidence hostile to the claim may be adduced. The copy of the
      first tract in the British Museum is the S. G. for Banks and Harper.{1}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  It is erroneously described as "an abridgment."
</pre>
    <p>
      No other London imprint is to be found there or in the larger libraries of
      England. Of the three other copies located, that sold at audion (the White
      Kennett copy) and that in the Massachusetts Historical Society came direct
      from England, and the actual provenance of the copy in the New York
      Historical Society is not known. It belonged to Rufus King, long United
      States minister near the court of St James's, and is bound with other
      tracts under a general title of "Topographical Collection, Vol. I." The
      binding, Mr. Kelby tells me, is American. There is no mark to show when or
      where King obtained the pamphlet, and the Society did not receive it until
      1906. That Rufus King belongs as much to Massachusetts as to New York is
      too slight a foundation on which to erect a claim that this particular
      tract was of Massachusetts origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no case, therefore, can an American setting to any one of the four
      known copies of the S. G. "Isle of Pines" be <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p022.png">[22]</a></span>established.{1} The probabilities
      are all against Samuel Green. The incident is a good example of the danger
      of giving play to the imagination on an appearance of a combination of
      fads cemented by interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus disappears from our memory the certain identification of the S. G.
      pamphlet as an early issue of the press in Cambridge, and with it goes my
      identification of the Johnson pamphlet with the S. G. title-page&mdash;a
      veritable pipe dream. It might be urged that as White Kennett was
      collecting on America, it would be more than probable that he would have
      had an American issue; but his own catalogue of 1713 describes the
      nine-page tract, and that is our London edition. I might claim still that
      my Johnson was a Johnson, with a London title-page; but the typographical
      adornment on the first page of its text is just the same as the adornment
      on the first page of the London issue&mdash;three rows of fleur-de-lys,
      thirty-seven in each row, and the same kind of type characters.{2}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Lowndes indexes it under George Pine, and describes a
     nine-page trait&mdash;probably the one now in the British Museum.
     He quotes a sale of a copy in it 60 (Puttkk) for £4.10s. He
     indexes the combined parts under Sloetten, and notes a copy,
     with the plate, sold in the White Knights sale for 1s..

     2  To attempt to reason from types or rule of thumb
     measurements, however suggestive, leads to indefinite
     conclusions. For example, the width of the type page of the
     S. G. issue of the first part is exactly that of the English
     issue of the second part, but the former has 33 tines to the
     page and the latter a a. The width of the page in the
     variant S. G. issue is narrower and there are 38 and 39
     lines to the page. But in the London second part the width
     of page varies by a quarter of an inch. We have Marmaduke
     Johnson's issue of Paine's <i>Daily Meditations</i> y issued in
     1670 in connection with S. G. The ornamental border of
     fleur-de-lys is entirely different from those in the S. G.
     <i>Isle of Pines</i>. A copy of Johnson's issue of Scottow's
     translation of Bretz on the Anabaptists, printed in 1668,
     the very year of the <i>Isle of Pines</i>, shows a different foot
     of italics from that used in the <i>Isle of Pines</i> variant,
     yet the roman characters in the two pieces seem identical,
     and the width of page is exactly the same.
</pre>
    <p>
      So I bid farewell to my theory, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p023.png">[23]</a></span>and can only congratulate myself
      on having cleared one point&mdash;the London issue&mdash;and on having
      introduced a new confusion by the discovery of a second London issue with
      an identical title-page, a problem for the future to solve. I much doubt
      if a true Johnson issue will ever be found, for I believe the action of
      the authorities prevented its birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the library of Mr. Henry E. Huntington is a London issue of which I do
      not find another example. It contains sixteen pages, and the title-page
      gives neither printer's name nor place of publication. It may be the first
      issue, or it may be a later re-issue of the tract, for the type,
      especially the italic, is better than that in the S. G. issue. The
      punctuation also is more carefully looked after, and the whole appearance
      suggests an eighteenth century print. As the original was duly licensed,
      there was no reason to suppress the names of printer or booksellers. Nor
      could the contents of the piece call out controversy or hostility from any
      political faction or religious following. It was proper for the author to
      omit his name from the publication, if he desired to remain unknown; but
      the publisher, having the support of the licenser, had every reason to
      advertise his connexion with the tract, although he could not have
      anticipated so ready an acceptance by the public. While I place the
      Huntington pamphlet first in the bibliography, I am more inclined to
      regard it as a publication made at a later time.

      THE COMBINED PARTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The English edition of thirty-one pages in the John Carter Brown Library,
      with an engraved frontispiece,{1} offers still further proof that the S.
      G. issue was made in London. In place of being entirely different from the
      S. G. tract, it is precisely the same so far as text is concerned. For it
      is nothing more than the two parts combined, but combined in a peculiar
      manner. The second part was opened at page 6 and the first part inserted,
      entire and without change of text{2} This insertion runs into page 16,
      where a sentence is inserted to carry on the relation: "After the reading
      and delivering unto us a Coppy of this Relation, then proceeded he on in
      his discourse." The rest of the text of the second part follows, and pages
      27-31 of the combined parts seem to be the very type pages of pages 20-24
      of the second part{3} In this sandwich form one must read six pages before
      coming to the text of the first part, and a careless reader, comparing
      only the respective first pages, would conclude that a pamphlet of
      thirty-one pages could have no likeness <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p025.png">[25]</a></span>to one of nine.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The plate in the copy in the John Carter Brown Library
     does not belong to that issue, but is inserted in so clumsy
     a manner as to prevent reproduction. The same plate is found
     in a copy of the ten-page S.G. issue in the library of Mr.
     Henry E. Huntington, and to all appearances belongs to that
     issue.

     2   The last sentence on page 6 of the second part read:
     "Then proceeded he on in his discourse saying," and there
     are no pages numbered 7 and 8, although there is no break in
     the text, the catch-word on page 6 being the first word on
     page 9. In the combined parts, the last words on page 6
     constitute a phrase: "which Copy hereafter followeth."

     3 The only change made is in the heading of the Post-script,
     which was wrongly printed in the second part as "Post-
     script." On page 26 of the combined parts the words "except
     burning" were inserted, not appearing in the second part.
</pre>
    <p>
      On typographical evidence it is safe to assume that the three pieces came
      from the same press, and to assert that the second part and the combined
      parts certainly did. The initials S. G. are found only on the first part.

    <h2>
      THE PUBLISHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The imprints of the three parts agree that the booksellers or publishers
      handling the editions were Allen Banks and Charles Harper. The first part
      gives their shop as the "Flower-De-luice near Cripplegate Church," the
      second part as the "Flower-de-luce" as before, and the combined parts as
      "next door to the three Squerrills in Fleet-street, over against St.
      Dunstans Church." The church is still there, with more than two centuries
      of dirt and soot marking its walls since Neville wrote, and Chancery and
      Fettar Lanes enable one to place quite accurately the location of the
      booksellers' shop. Only three times do the names of Banks and Harper
      appear as partners on the Stationers' Registers,{1} and they separated
      about 1671, Banks going to the "St Peter at the West End of St Pauls." If
      any judgment may be drawn from their publications after ceasing to be
      partners, Banks leaned to light literature and may have been responsible
      for taking up the "Isle of Pines." Yet Harper was Neville's publisher in
      1674 and in 1681, a fact which may indicate a personal relation.{2}

    <h2>
      NOT AN AMERICAN ITEM
    </h2>
    <p>
      By some curious chance this little pamphlet has come to be classed as
      Americana. Bishop Kenneth's Catalogue may have been the source of this
      error, leading collectors to believe that the item was a true relation of
      an actual voyage, and possibly touching upon some phase of American
      history or geography. The rarity of the pamphlet would not permit such a
      belief to be readily corrected. The existence also of two Isles of Pines
      in American waters may have aided the belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these islands is off the southwestern end of Cuba. On his second
      voyage, Columbus had sailed along the south coast of Cuba, and June
      13,1494, reached an island, which he named Evangelista. Here he
      encountered such difficulties among the shoals that he determined to
      retrace his course to the eastward. But for that experience, he might have
      reached the mainland of America on that voyage. The conquest of the island
      of Cuba by Diego Velasquez in 1511 led to its exploration; but geographers
      could only slowly appreciate what the islands really meant, for they were
      as much misled by the reports of navigators as Columbus had been by his
      prejudice in favor of Cathay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toscanelli's map of the Atlantic Ocean (1474) gives many islands between
      Cape Verde and the "coast of spices," of which "Cippangu" is the largest
      and most important.{1}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  This map, as reconstructed from Martin Behaim's globe, is
     in <i>Scottish Geographical Magazine</i>, 1893.
</pre>
    <p>
      On Juan de laCosa's sea chart, 1500, Cuba is fairly drawn, with the sea to
      the south dotted with islands without names. In a few years the mist
      surrounding <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p027.png">[27]</a></span>the
      new world had so far been dispelled as to disclose a quite accurate detail
      of the larger West Indian islands{1} and to offer a continent to the west,
      one that placed Cipangu still far too much to the east of the coast of
      Asia.{2} An island of some size off the southwest of Cuba seems to have
      been intended at first for Jamaica, but certainly as early as 1536 that
      island had passed to its true position on the maps, and the island to the
      west is without a name. Nor can it be confused with Yucatan, which for
      forty years was often drawn as an island. On the so-called
      Wolfenbuttel-Spanish map of 1525-30 occurs the name "J. de Pinos,"
      probably the first occurrence of the name upon any map in the sixteenth
      century. Two other maps of that time&mdash;Colon's and Ribero's, dated
      respectively 1527 and 1529&mdash;call it "Y de Pinos," and on the globe of
      Ulpius, to which the year 1542 is assigned, "de Pinos" is clearly marked.
      Bellero's map, 1550, has an island "de pinolas." Naturally, map-makers
      were slow to adopt new names, and in the numerous editions of Ptolemy the
      label St Iago was retained almost to the end of the century.{3} On the
      Agnese map there are two islands, one named "S. Tiago," the other "pinos,"
      which introduced a new confusion, though he was not followed by most
      geographers until Wytfliet, 1597, gave both names to the same island&mdash;"S.
      Iago siue Y de Pinas"&mdash;in which he is followed by Hondius, 1633.{4}
      Ortelius, 1579, <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p028.png">[28]</a></span>adopts
      "I Pinnorum," while Linschoten, 1598, has "Pinas," and Herrera, 1601,
      "Pinos."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  The Agnese Atlas of 1529 may be cited as an example.

     2   See, for example, the so-called Stobnicza [Joannes,
     Stobnicensis] map of 151a, and the Ptolemy of 1513
     (Strassburg).

     3  Muenster, 1540. Cabot, 1544, and Desceller, 1546, give "Y
     de Pinos."

     4  Mr. P. Lee Phillips, to whom I am indebted for references
     to atlases of the time, also supplies the following:
     Lafreri, 1575 (?) "S. Tiagoj" Percacchi, 1576, "S. Tiago;"
     Santa Cruz, 1541, "Ya de Pinosj" and Dudley, 1647, "I de
     Pinos." Hakloyt (iii. 617) prints a "Ruttier" for the
     West Indies, without date, but probably of the end of the
     sixteenth century, which contains the following; "The
     markes of Isla de Pinos. The Island of Pinos stretcheth it
     selfe East and West, and is full of homocks, and if you
     chance to see it at full sea, it will shew like 3 Islands,
     as though there were divers soundes betweene them, and that
     in the midst is the greatest; and in rowing with them, it
     will make all a firme lande: and upon the East side of these
     three homocks it will shewe all ragged; and on the West
     side of them will appeare unto you a lowe point even with
     the sea, and oftentimes you shall see the trees before you
     shall discerne the point."
</pre>
    <p>
      When the name given by Columbus was dropped and by whom the island was
      named "de Pinos" cannot be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our colleague, Mr. Francis R. Hart, has called my attention to a second
      Isle of Pines in American waters, being near Golden Island, which was
      situated in the harbor or bay on which the Scot Darien expedition made its
      settlement of New Edinburgh. The bay is still known as Caledonia Bay, and
      the harbor as Porto Escoces, but the Isla de Pinas as well as a river of
      the same name do not appear on maps of the region. The curious may find
      references to the island in the printed accounts of the unfortunate Darien
      colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Isle of Pines could thus be found on the map as an actual island in
      the West Indies; but the "Isle of Pines" of our tract existed only in the
      imagination of the writer. The mere fact of its having been printed&mdash;but
      not published&mdash;in Cambridge, Massachusetts, does not entitle it to be
      classed even indirectly as Americana, any more than Bunyan's Pilgrim's
      Progress or <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p029.png">[29]</a></span>Thomas
      à Kempis could be so marked on the strength of their having a
      Massachusetts imprint Curiosities of the American press they may be, but
      they serve only as crude measures of the existing taste for literature
      since become recognized as classic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dignified Calendar of State Papers in the Public Record Office,
      London, gravely indexes a casual reference to the tract under West Indies,
      and the impression that the author wrote of the Cuban island probably
      accounts for the different editions in the John Carter Brown Library, as
      well as for the price obtained for the White Kennett copy. No possible
      reason can be found, however, for regarding the "Isle of Pines" in any of
      its forms as Americana.

      THE AUTHOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus far I have been concerned with externals, and before turning to the
      contents of the tract itself in an endeavor to explain the extraordinary
      popularity it enjoyed, something must be said of the author&mdash;Henry
      Neville. Like most of the characters engaged in the politics of England in
      the middle of the seventeenth century, he has suffered at the hands of his
      biographer, Anthony à Wood,{1} merely because he belonged to the opposite
      party&mdash;the crudest possible measure of merit For the <i>odium
      politicum</i> and the <i>odium theologicum</i> are twin agents of
      detraction, and the writing of history would be dull indeed were it not
      for the joy of digging out an approximation to the truth from opposing
      opinions. Where the material is so scanty it will be safer <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p030.png">[30]</a></span>to summarize
      what is known, without attempting to pass finally upon Neville's position
      among his contemporaries.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      The second son of Sir Henry Neville, and grandson of Sir Henry Neville
      (1564?-1615), courtier and diplomatist under Elizabeth and James I, Henry
      Neville was born in Billing-bear, Berkshire, in 1620. He became a commoner
      of Merton College in 1635, and soon after migrated to University College,
      where he passed some years but took no degree. He travelled on the
      continent, becoming familiar with modern languages and men, and returned
      to England in 1645, to recruit for Abingdon for the parliament Wood states
      that Neville "was very great with Harry Marten, Tho. Chaloner, Tho. Scot,
      Jam. Harrington and other zealous commonwealths men." His association with
      them probably arose from his membership of the council of state (1651),
      and also from his agreement with them in their suspicions of Cromwell,
      who, in his opinion, "gaped after the government by a single person." In
      consequence he was banished from London in 1654, and on Oliver's death was
      returned to parliament December 30,1658, as burgess for Reading. An
      attempt to exclude him on charges of atheism and blasphemy failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was undoubtedly somewhat closely associated with James Harrington, the
      author of "Oceana," and was regarded as a "strong doctrinaire republican."
      He was a member of the club&mdash;the Rota&mdash;formed by Harrington for
      discussing and disseminating his political views, a club which continued
      in existence only a few months, from November, 1659, to February, 1660;
      but its name is embalmed in one of Harrington's essays&mdash;"The Rota"&mdash;published
      in 1660, and extracted from his "Art of Law-giving," <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p031.png">[31]</a></span>which was itself an abridgment of
      the "Oceana."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, says Wood, Neville was "esteemed to be a man of good parts,
      yet of a factious and turbulent spirit." On the restoration he "sculk'd
      for a time," and, arrested for a supposed connection in the Yorkshire
      rising of 1663, he was released for want of evidence against him, retiring
      from all participation in politics. For twenty years before his death he
      lived in lodgings in Silver Street, near Bloomsbury market, and dying on
      September 20, 1694, he was buried in the parish church of Warfield,
      Berkshire. By his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Staverton of
      Warfield, he had no issue.{2} In his retirement he found occupation in
      political theory. He translated some of the writings of Machiavelli, which
      he had obtained in Italy in 1645, and published some verses of little
      merit.

    <p>
      It cannot be said that a reading of Neville's productions before 1681
      raises him in our estimation, it certainly does not give the impression of
      a man of letters, a student of government, or even a politician of the
      day. There is always the possibility in these casual writings of a purpose
      deeper than appears to the reader of the present day, of a meaning which
      escapes him because the special combination of events creating the
      occasion cannot be reconstructed. The "Parliament of Ladies," which was
      published in two parts in 1647, has little meaning to the reader, though
      they appeared in the year when the Parliament took notice of the "many
      Seditious, False and Scandalous Papers and Pamphlets daily printed and
      published in and about the cities of London and Westminster, and thence
      dispersed <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p032.png">[32]</a></span>into
      all parts of this Realm, and other parts beyond the Seas, to the great
      abuse and prejudice of the People, and insufferable reproach of the
      proceedings of the Parliament and their Army."{1}
    </p>
    <p>
      To write, print, or sell any unlicensed matter whatsoever would be liable
      to fine or imprisonment, and to whet the zeal of discovery one-half of the
      fine was to go to the informer. Every publication, from a book to a
      broadsheet, must bear the name of author, printer, and licenser. Neither
      of Neville's pamphlets of 1647 conformed to the requirements of this act,
      which is not, however, positive evidence that they did not appear after
      the promulgation of the law. Suppression of printing has proved a
      difficult task to rulers, even when supported by public opinion or an
      army. The Stationers' Registers show that the "Parliament of Ladies" and
      its sequel were not properly entered; nor do they contain any reference to
      Neville's "News from the New Exchange," issued in 1650.{2}
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine years passed before he printed a pamphlet which marked his break with
      Cromwell&mdash;"Shuffling, Cutting, and Dealing in a Game of Picquet."{3}

      This little pamphlet was put out in the poorest dress possible, bespeaking
      a press of meagre equipment, and a printer without an idea of the form
      which even the leaflet can assume in skilful hands. Without imprint,
      author's name, or any mark of identification, it indicates a secret
      impression and <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p033.png">[33]</a></span>issue&mdash;one
      of the many occasional pamphlets which appeared at the time from

      In 1681 he printed "Discourses concerning Government," which was much
      admired by Hobbes, and even Wood admits that it was "very much bought up
      by the members [of parliament], and admired: But soon after, when they
      understood who the author was (for his name was not set to the book), many
      of the honest party rejected, and had no opinion of it" A later writer
      describes it as an "un-Platonic dialogue developing a scheme for the
      exercise of the royal prerogative through councils of state responsible to
      Parliament, and of which a third part should retire every year."{1}

      It may be admitted that questions of government were eagerly discussed in
      the seventeenth century. It was only needed to live under the Stuarts and
      to pass through the Civil War and Protectorate to realize that a
      transition from the divinely anointed ruler to a self-constituted governor
      resting upon an army, and again to a trial of the legitimate holder of
      royal prerogative, offered an education in matters of political rule which
      naturally led to a constitutional monarchy, and which could not be
      equalled in degree or lasting importance until the American colonies of
      Great Britain questioned the policy of the mother country toward her all
      too energetic children. Hobbes' "Leviathan, or the Matter, Form and Power
      of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil," appeared in 1651, a powerful
      argument for absolutism, but cast in such a form as to make the <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p036.png">[36]</a></span>writer an
      unwelcome adherent to royalty in exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1652 Filmer published his "Observations concerning the Original of
      Government," one of a series of tracts, completed by his "Patriarcha,"
      printed after his death, which has made him a prophet of the extreme
      supporters of the divine origin of kingship. These are only examples of
      the political discussion of the day, and to them may be added Harrington,
      whose "Oceanan" appeared in 1656.{1} It satisfied no party or faction, and
      a second edition was not called for until 1700, when other writings of the
      author were added. This compilation was, in 1737, pirated by a Dublin
      printer, R. Reilly, who added Neville's "Plato Redivivus;"{2} but the
      third English edition (1747), issued by the same printer who made the
      second edition, omitted Neville's tract.

    <h2>
      THE STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The Isle of Pines" was Neville's fifth publication, issued nine years
      after his fourth, a political tract: "Shuffling, Cutting and Dealing in a
      Game of Picquet" Like most titles of the day, that of "The Isle of Pines"
      did not fail in quantity. It was repeated word for word, except the
      imprint, on the first page of the text. Briefly, the relation purports to
      have been written by an Englishman, George Pine, who at the age of twenty
      shipped as book-keeper in the <i>India Merchant</i>, which sailed for the
      East Indies in 1569.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having rounded the Cape of Good Hope and <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p037.png">[37]</a></span>being almost within sight of St.
      Lawrence's Island, now Madagascar,{1} they encountered a great storm of
      wind, which separated the ship from her consorts, blew many days, and
      finally wrecked the vessel on a rocky island. The entire company was
      drowned except Pine, the daughter of his master, two maid-servants, and
      one negro female slave. They gathered what they could of the wreckage, and
      Pine and his companions lived there in community life, a free-love
      settlement By the four women he had forty-seven children, and in his
      sixtieth year he claimed to have 565 children, grandchildren, and
      great-grandchildren. It was from one of his grandchildren that the Dutch
      ship received the relation. Apart from the title-page, the entire tract is
      occupied by the story of George Pine, from whom the island took its name.
      In 1667, or ninety-eight years after Pine was wrecked, the Dutch captain
      estimated that the population of the island amounted to ten or twelve
      thousand persons. Methuselah, with his years to plead for him, might boast
      of such breeding, but in ordinary man it is too near the verminous, the
      rat, the guinea-pig, and the rabbit, to be pleasant.

</pre>
    <p>
      The publication must have attracted attention at once, for before the end
      of July Neville put forth a second part, "A New and further Discovery of
      The Isle of Pines," which purported to be the relation of the Dutch
      captain to whom the history of Pines had been confided. It is an unadorned
      story such as might have been gathered from a dozen tales in Hakluyt or
      Purchas, and is interesting only in giving the name of the <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p038.png">[38]</a></span>Dutch captain&mdash;Cornelius
      Van Sloetton&mdash;and the location of the supposed island&mdash;longitude
      76° and latitude 20°, under the third climate&mdash;which places it to the
      northeast of Madagascar. Almost immediately after the publication of the
      second part it was combined with the first part, as already described, and
      published late in July or early in August Cornelius Van Sloetton, as he
      signed himself in the second part, became Henry Cornelius Van Sloetten in
      the combined issue.

    <h2>
      INTERPRETATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Pine's relation which received the greatest attention on the
      continent, and that was chiefly concerned in describing his performances
      in populating the island. It was therefore with only a mild surprise that
      I read in one of those repulsively thorough studies which only a German
      can make, a study made in 1668 of this very tract, "The Isle of Pines,"
      the assertion that Pines, masquerading as the name of the discoverer and
      patriarch of the island, and accepted as the name of the island itself,
      was only an anagram on the male organ of generation&mdash;penis. On one of
      the German issues in the John Carter Brown <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p039.png">[39]</a></span>Library this has also been noted
      by a contemporary hand.{1} Such an interpretation reduces our tract to a
      screaming farce, but it closely suits the general tone of other of
      Neville's writings, which are redolent of the sensual license of the
      restoration. To this I would add an emendation of my own. The name adopted
      by Neville was Henry Cornelius van Sloetten. It suggests a somewhat
      forcible English word&mdash;slut&mdash;of doubtful origin, although forms
      having some resemblance in sound and sense occur in the Scandinavian
      languages.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      Such interpretations seem to fit the work better than that of a German
      critic, who sees in the book a sort of Utopia, a model community, or an
      exhibition in the development of law and order. Free love led to license,
      maids were ravished, and the complete promiscuity of intercourse disgusted
      Pine, who sought to suppress it by force and, in killing the leader of a
      revolt, a man with negro blood in his veins, to impose punishments for
      acts which he had himself done. The ground for believing that Neville had
      any such purpose when he wrote the book is too slight to be accepted. In
      1668 the author had no call to convey a lesson in government to his
      countrymen by any means so frankly vulgar and pointless as the "Isle of
      Pines." If Neville had intended such a political object, a phrase would
      have sufficed to indicate it. No such key can be found in the text, and
      there is nothing to show that, politician as he was, he realized that such
      an intimation could be drawn from his paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assume, therefore, that so carefully hidden a suggestion of a model
      republic could have aided the circulation <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p040.png">[40]</a></span>of the pamphlet at the time, or at
      any later period, is to introduce an element unnecessary to explain the
      vogue of the relation. It passed simply as a story of adventure, and as
      such it fell upon a time when a wide public was receptive to the point of
      being easily duped. Wood asserts that the "Isle of Pines," when first
      published, "was look'd upon as a mere sham or piece of drollery; "{1} and
      there are few contemporary references to the relation of either Pine or
      Van Sloetten, and those few are of little moment If the seamen, who were
      in a position to point out discrepancies of fad in the story, made any
      comment or criticism, I have failed to discover them.

      Neville himself freely played with the subject, and it is strange that he
      did not excite some suspicion of his veracity among his readers. He had
      told in his first part of a Dutch ship which was driven by foul weather to
      the island and of the giving to the Dutch the story of Pine. His second
      part is the story of the Dutch captain, sailing from Amsterdam,
      re-discovering the Isle of Pines, and returning home&mdash;that is, to
      Holland. Yet Neville for the combined issue, and presumably only a few
      days after giving out the first part, composed two letters from a merchant
      of Amsterdam&mdash;Abraham Keek&mdash;dated June 29 and July 6, saying
      that the last post from Rochelle brought intelligence of a French vessel
      which had just arrived and reported the discovery of this very island, but
      placing it some two or three hundred leagues "Northwest from Cape Finis
      Terre," though, he added with reasonable caution, "it may be that there
      may be some mistake in the number of the Leagues, as also of the exact
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p041.png">[41]</a></span>point of
      the compass from Cape Finis Terre."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keek offered an additional piece of geographical information, that "some
      English here suppose it maybe the Island of Brasile which have been so oft
      sought for, Southwest from Ireland."{1} The first letter of Keek is dated
      five days after the licensing of the first part of the "Isle of Pines,"
      and the second sixteen days before the date of Sloetten's narrative. It is
      hardly possible that Neville could have been forgetful of his having made
      a Dutch vessel responsible for the discovery and history of Pine, and it
      is more than probable that he took this means of giving greater
      verisimilitude to the Isle of Pines, by bringing forward an independent
      discovery by a French vessel. However intended, the ruse did not
      contribute to such a purpose, as the combined parts did not enjoy as wide
      a circulation as the first part.

      On the continent a German, who knew the tract only as translated into
      German through a Dutch version of the English text, and therefore
      imperfectly, gave it serious consideration, and had little difficulty in
      finding inconsistencies and contradictions. Some of his questions went to
      the root of the matter. It was a Dutch ship which first found the Isle of
      Pines and its colony; why was not the discovery first announced by the
      Dutch? Piece by piece the critic takes down the somewhat clumsily
      fashioned structure of Neville's fiction, and in the end little remains
      untouched by suspicion. No such examination, dull and labored in form, and
      offering no trace of imagination which wisely permits itself to be
      deceived in details in order to be free to accept a whole, could pass
      beyond the narrow circle of a university.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p042.png">[42]</a></span>As an
      antidote to the attractions of Neville's tract it was powerless, and
      to-day it remains as much of a curiosity as it was in 1668, when it was
      written. Indeed, a question might be raised as to which tract was less
      intentionally a joke&mdash;Neville's "Isle of Pines," or our German's
      ponderous essay upon it? At least the scientific ignorance of the
      Englishman, perfectly evident from the start, is more entertaining than
      the pseudo-science of the German critic, who boldly asserts as impossible
      what has come to be a commonplace.{1}

      Hippe calls attention to the geography of the relation as not the least
      interesting of its features, for the neighborhood of the Island of
      Madagascar was used in other sea stories as a place of storm and
      catastrophe. "The ship on which Simplicissimus wished to return to
      Portugal, suffered shipwreck likewise near Madagascar, and the paradisiac
      island on which Grimmelshausen permits his hero finally to land in company
      with a carpenter, is also to be sought in this region. In precisely the
      same way the shipwreck of Sadeur,{1} the hero of a French Robinson Crusoe
      story, <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p043.png">[43]</a></span>happens
      on the coast of Madagascar, and from this was he driven in a southerly
      direction to the coast of the southern land."

      In most of the older surveys of the known world America counts as the
      fourth part, naturally coming after Europe, Asia, and Africa. Even that
      arrangement was not generally accepted. Joannes Leo (Hasan Ibn Muhammad,
      al-Wazzan), writing in 1556, properly called Africa "la tierce Partie du
      Monde;" but the Seigneur de la Popellinière, in his "Les Trois Mondes,"
      published in 1582, divided the globe into three parts&mdash;1. Europe,
      Asia, and Africa; 2. America, and 3. Australia. A half century later,
      Pierre d'Avitz, of Toumon (Ardèche), entitled one of his compositions
      "Description Générale de l'Amérique troisiesme partie du Monde," first
      published in 1637.{2} The expedition under Alvaro de Mendana de Nevra,
      setting sail from Callao, November 19, 1567, and steering westward, sought
      to clear doubt concerning a continent which report had pictured as being
      somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The Solomon Islands rewarded the
      enterprise, and with New Guinea and the Philippines completed a connection
      between Peru and the continent of Asia. There had long existed, however, a
      settled belief in the existence of a great continent in the southern
      hemisphere, which should serve as a counterpoise to the known lands in the
      northern.

      The geographical ideas of the times required such a continent, <span

      the circumnavigation of Africa, the world-maps indicated to the southward
      "terra incognita secundum Ptolemeum,"{1} or a land of extreme temperature
      and wholly unknown.{2} The sailing of ships round the Cape of Good Hope
      dissipated in some degree this belief but it merely placed some distance
      between that cape and the supposed Terra Australia which was now extended
      to the south of America, separated on the maps from that continent only by
      the narrow Straits of Magellan, and stretching to the westward, almost
      approaching New Guinea.{3}

      Such an expanse of undiscovered land, believed to be rich in gold,
      awakened the resolution of Pedro Fernandez de Queiros, who had been a
      pilot in the Mendafia voyage of 1606. By chance he failed in his object,
      and deceived by the apparent continuous coast line presented to his view
      by the islands of the New Hebrides group, he gave it the resounding name
      of Austrialia del Espiritu Santo, because of the King's title of Austria.
      On the publication of his "Relation" at Seville in 1610, the name was
      altered, and he claimed to have discovered the "fourth part of the world,
      called Terra Australis incognita." Seven years later, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p045.png">[45]</a></span>in 1617, it was published in
      London under the title, "Terra Australia incognita, or A new Southerne
      Discoverie, containing a fifth part of the World." It is obvious that
      geographers and their source of information&mdash;the adventurous sea
      captains&mdash;were not agreed upon the proper number to be assigned to
      the Terra Australis in the world scheme. Even in 1663 the Church seemed in
      doubt, for a father writes "Mémoires touchant l'établissement d'une
      Mission Chrestienne dans la troisième Monde, autrement apellé la Terre
      Australe, Méridionale, Antartique, &amp; I connue."{1} That Neville even
      drew his title from any of these publications cannot be asserted, nor do
      they explain his designation of the Isle of Pines as the fourth island in
      this southern land; but they show the common meaning attached to <i>Terra
      Australis incognita</i>, and his use of the words was a clever, even if
      not an intentional appeal to the curiosity then so active on continents
      yet to be discovered.

     John Callender in compiling his Terra Australis Cogmta,
     1766-68.

      Another volume, however, written by one who afterwards became Bishop of
      Norwich, may have been responsible for the conception of Neville's
      pamphlet. This was Joseph Hall's "Mundus Alter et Idem sive Terra
      Australis ante hac semper incognita longis itineribus peregrini Academici
      nuperrime lustrata." The title says it was printed at Frankfort, and the
      statement has been too readily accepted as the fact, for the tract was
      entered at <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p046.png">[46]</a></span>Stationers'
      Hall by John Porter, June 2, 1605, and again on August 1, 1608.{1} The
      biographer of Bishop Hall states that it was published at Frankfort by a
      friend, in 1605, and republished at Hanau in 1607, and in a translated
      form in London about 1608. It is more than probable that all three issues
      were made in London, and that the so-called Hanau edition was that entered
      in 1608. On January 18, 1608-09, Thomas Thorpe entered the translation,
      with the address to the reader signed John Healey, who was the
      translator.{2} This carried the title: "The Discovery of a New World, or a
      Description of the South Indies hitherto unknown."{3} It is a satirical
      work with no pretense of touching upon realities. Hallam wrote of it: "I
      can only produce two books by English authors in this first part of the
      seventeenth century which fall properly under the class of novels or
      romances; and of these one is written in Latin. This is the Mundus Alter
      and Idem of Bishop Hall, an imitation of the later and weaker volumes of
      Rabelais. A country in Terra Australis is divided into four regions,
      Crapulia, Virginia, Moronea, and Lavernia. Maps of the whole land and of
      particular regions are given; and the nature of the satire, not much of
      which has any especial reference to England, may easily be collected. It
      is not a very successful effort."{4}

      While a later critic, Canon <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p047.png">[47]</a></span>Perry, says of it: "This strange
      composition, sometimes erroneously described as a 'political romance,' to
      which it bears no resemblance whatever, is a moral satire in prose, with a
      strong undercurrent of bitter jibes at the Romish church, and its
      eccentricities, which sufficiently betray the author's main purpose in
      writing it. It shows considerable imagination, wit, and skill in latinity,
      but it has not enough of verisimilitude to make it an effective satire,
      and does not always avoid scurrility."{1} Like Neville's production, the
      satire was misinterpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title of Neville's tract also recalls the lost play of Thomas Nash&mdash;"The
      Isle of Dogs"&mdash;for which he was imprisoned on its appearance in 1597,
      and suffered, as he asserted, for the indiscretion of others. "As Actaeon
      was worried by his own hounds," wrote Francis Meres in his "Palladis
      Tamia," "so is Tom Nash of his Isle of Dogs." And three years later, in
      1600, Nash referred in his "Summers Last Will" to the excitement raised by
      his suppressed play. "Here's a coil about dogs without wit! If I had
      thought the ship of fools would have stay'd to take in fresh water at the
      Isle of Dogs, I would have furnish'd it with a whole kennel of collections
      to the purpose." The incident was long remembered. Nine years after Nash's
      experience John Day published his "Isle of Gulls," drawn from Sir Philip
      Sidney's "Arcadia."{2}

    <h2>
      DEFOE AND THE "ISLE OF PINES"
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would apologize for taking so much time on a nine-page hoax did it not
      offer something positive in the history of English literature. It has long
      been recognized as one of the more than possible sources of Defoe's
      "Robinson Crusoe." It is truly said that the elements of a masterpiece
      exist for years before they become embodied, that they are floating in the
      air, as it were, awaiting the master workman who can make that use which
      gives to them permanent interest Life on an island, entirely separated
      from the rest of mankind, had formed an incident in many tales, but
      Neville's is believed to have been the first employment by an English
      author of island life for the whole story. And while Defoe excludes the
      most important feature of Neville's tract&mdash;woman&mdash;from his
      "Robinson Crusoe," issued in April, 1719, he too, four months after,
      published the "Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe," in which woman has
      a share. It would be wearisome to undertake a comparison of incident;
      suffice it to say that the "Isle of Pines" has been accepted as a
      pre-Defoe romance, to which the far greater Englishman may have been
      indebted.

        this City, that there was a French &#383;hip arrived, the Mailer and
        Company of which reports, that about 2 or 300 Leagues Northwe&#383;t
        from Cape Finis Terre, they fell in with an I&#383;land, where they went
        on &#383;hore, and found about 2000 Engli&#383;h people without
        cloathes, only &#383;ome &#383;mall coverings about their middle, and
        that they related to them, that at their fir&#383;t coming to this I&#383;land

      <p>
        April the 26th 1667. We &#383;et &#383;ail from Am&#383;terdam,
        intending for the Ea&#383;t-Indies; our &#383;hip had to name the place
        from whence we came, the <i>Am&#383;terdam</i> burthen 350. Tun, and
        having a fair gale of Wind, on the 27 of May following we had a &#383;ight
        of the high Peak Tenriffe belonging to the Canaries, we have touched at
        the I&#383;land Palma, but having endeavoured it twice, and finding the
        winds contrary, we &#383;teered on our course by the I&#383;les of Cape
        Ferd, or In&#383;ula Capitis Viridis, where at St. James's we <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p056.png">[56]</a></span>took in fre&#383;h
        water, with &#383;ome few Goats, and Hens, wherewith that I&#383;land
        doth plentifully abound.
      </p>
      <p>
        June the 14. we had a &#383;ight of Madaga&#383;car, or the I&#383;land
        of St Laurence, an I&#383;land of 4000 miles in compa&#383;s, and &#383;cituate
        under the Southern Tropick; thither we &#383;teered our cour&#383;e, and
        trafficked with the inhabitants for Knives, Beads, Gla&#383;&#383;es and
        the like, having in exchange thereof Cloves and Silver. Departing from
        thence we were incountred with a violent &#383;torm, and the winds
        holding contrary, for the &#383;pace of a fortnight, brought us back
        almo&#383;t as far as the I&#383;le Del Principe; during which time many
        of our men fell &#383;ick, and &#383;ome dyed, but at the end of that
        time it plea&#383;ed God the wind favoured us again, and we &#383;teered
        on our cour&#383;e merrily, for the &#383;pace of ten days: when on a
        &#383;udden we were encountered with &#383;uch a violent &#383;torm, as
        if all the four winds together had con&#383;pired for our de&#383;truction,
        &#383;o that the &#383;toute&#383;t &#383;pirit of us all quailed,
        expecting every hour to be devoured by that mercile&#383;s element of
        water, &#383;ixteen dayes together <span class="oldnum">{{3 }}</span>
        did this &#383;torm continue, though not with &#383;uch violence as at
        the fir&#383;t, the Weather being &#383;o dark all the while, and the
        Sea &#383;o rough, that we knew not in what place we were, at length all
        on a &#383;udden the Wind cea&#383;ed, and the Air cleared, the Clouds
        were all di&#383;per&#383;ed, and a very &#383;erene Sky followed, for
        which we gave hearty thanks to the Almighty, it being beyond our
        expectation that we &#383;hould have e&#383;caped the violence of that
        &#383;torm.
      </p>
      <p>
        At length one of our men mounting the Main-ma&#383;t e&#383;pyed fire,
        an evident &#383;ign of &#383;ome Countrey near adjoyning, which pre&#383;ently
        after we apparently di&#383;covered, and &#383;teering our cour&#383;e
        <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p057.png">[57]</a></span>more
        nigher, we &#383;aw &#383;everal per&#383;ons promi&#383;cuou&#383;ly
        running about the shore, as it were wondering and admiring at what they
        &#383;aw: Being now near to the Land, we manned out our long Boat with
        ten per&#383;ons, who approaching the &#383;hore, asked them in our
        Dutch Tongue What Eyland is dit? to which they returned this An&#383;wer
        in Engli&#383;h, "that they knew not what we &#383;aid." One of our
        Company named Jeremiah Hanzen who under&#383;tood Engli&#383;h very
        well, hearing their words di&#383;cour&#383;t to them in their own
        Language; &#383;o that in fine we were very kindly invited on &#383;hore,
        great numbers of them flocking about us, admiring at our Cloaths which
        we did wear, as we on the other &#383;ide did to find in &#383;uch a
        &#383;trange place, &#383;o many that could &#383;peak Engli&#383;h and
        yet to go naked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four of our men returning back in the long Boat to our Ships company,
        could hardly make them believe the truth of what they had &#383;een and
        heard, but when we had brought our &#383;hip into harbour, you would
        have ble&#383;t your &#383;elf to &#383;ee how the naked I&#383;landers
        flocked unto us, &#383;o wondering at our &#383;hip, as if it had been
        the greate&#383;t miracle of Nature in whole World. <span class="oldnum">{{4

      <p>
        We were very courteou&#383;ly entertained by them, pre&#383;enting us
        with &#383;uch food as that Countrey afforded, which indeed was not to
        be de&#383;pi&#383;ed; we eat of the Fle&#383;h both of Bea&#383;ts, and
        Fowls, which they had cleanly dre&#383;t, though with no great curio&#383;ity,
        as wanting materials, wherewithal to do it; and for bread we had the in&#383;ide
        or Kernel of a great Nut as big as an Apple, which was very whol&#383;ome,
        and found for the body, and ta&#383;ted to the Pallat very delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having refre&#383;hed our &#383;elves, they invited us to the Pallace
        <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p058.png">[58]</a></span>of
        their Prince or chief Ruler, &#383;ome two miles di&#383;tant off from
        the place where we landed; which we found to be about the bigne&#383;s
        of one of our ordinary village hou&#383;es, it was &#383;upported with
        rough unhewn pieces of Timber, and covered very artificially with
        boughs, &#383;o that it would keep out the greate&#383;t &#383;howers of
        Rain, the &#383;ides thereof were adorned with &#383;everal forts of
        Flowers, which the fragrant fields there do yield in great variety. The
        Prince him&#383;elf (who&#383;e name was <i>William Pine</i> the
        Grandchild of <i>George Pine</i> that was fir&#383;t on &#383;hore in
        this I&#383;land) came to his Pallace door and &#383;aluted us very
        courteou&#383;ly, for though he had nothing of Maje&#383;ty in him, yet
        had he a courteous noble and deboneyre &#383;pirit, wherewith your Engli&#383;h

        variety of colours became her admirably. Her privities were hid with
        &#383;ome pieces of old Garments, the Relicts of tho&#383;e Cloaths (I

        dulled, that it would not cut at all, &#383;ome few other things we al&#383;o
        gave him, which he very thankfully accepted, inviting us into his Hou&#383;e

        After &#383;ome little pau&#383;e, our Companion (who could &#383;peak

        &#383;hip &#383;plit all in pieces; the whole company perishing in the
        Waters, &#383;aving only him and four women, which by means of a broken
        piece of that Ship, by Divine a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance got on Land.

        What after pa&#383;&#383;ed (&#383;aid he) during my Grandfathers life,
        I &#383;hall &#383;how you in a Relation thereof written by his own
        hand, which he delivered to my Father being his elde&#383;t Son,
        charging him to have a &#383;pecial care thereof, and a&#383;huring him
        that time would bring &#383;ome people or other thither to whom he would
        have him to impart it, that the truth of our fir&#383;t planting here
        might not be quite lo&#383;t, which his commands my Father dutifully
        obeyed; but no one coming, he at his death delivered the &#383;ame with
        the like charge to me, and you being the fir&#383;t people, which (be&#383;ides
        our &#383;elves) ever &#383;et footing in this I&#383;land, I shall
        therefore in obedience to my Grandfathers and Fathers commands,
        willingly impart the &#383;ame unto you.

        Then &#383;tepping into a kind of inner room, which as we conceived was
        his lodging Chamber, he brought forth two sheets of paper fairly written
        in Engli&#383;hy (being the &#383;ame Relation which you had Printed
        with you at London) and very di&#383;tinctly read the &#383;ame over
        unto us, which we hearkened unto with great delight and admiration,
        freely proffering us a Copy of the &#383;ame, which we afterward took

        many days, that lo&#383;ing all hope of &#383;afety, being out of our
        own knowledge, and whether we &#383;hould fall on Flats or Rocks,
        uncertain in the nights, not having the lea&#383;t benefit of the light,
        we feared mo&#383;t, alwayes wi&#383;hing for day, and then for Land,
        but it came too &#383;oon for our good; for about the fir&#383;t of
        October, our fears having made us forget how the time pa&#383;&#383;ed
        to a certainty; we about the break of day di&#383;cerned Land (but what
        we knew not) the Land &#383;eemed high and Rockey, and the Sea continued
        &#383;till very &#383;tormy and tempe&#383;tuous, in&#383;omuch as there
        &#383;eemed no hope of &#383;afety, but looked &#383;uddenly to peri&#383;h.
        As we grew near Land, perceiving no &#383;afety in the &#383;hip, which
        we looked would &#383;uddenly be beat in pieces: The Captain, my Ma&#383;ter,
        and &#383;ome others got into the long Boat, thinking by that means to

        Negro were left on board, for we could not &#383;wim; but tho&#383;e
        that left us, might as well have tarried with us, for we &#383;aw them,

        follow their fortune, but God was plea&#383;ed to &#383;pare our lives,
        as it were by miracle, though to further &#383;orrow; for when we came
        again&#383;t the Rocks, our &#383;hip having endured two or three blows
        again&#383;t the Rocks, (being now broken and quite foundred in the
        Waters), we having with much ado gotten our &#383;elves on the Bow&#383;pright,
        which being broken off, was driven by the Waves into a &#383;mall Creek,
        wherein fell a little River, which being encompa&#383;&#383;ed by the
        Rocks <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p063.png">[63]</a></span>was

        be&#383;ides the Negro: when we were got upon the Rock, we could
        perceive the mi&#383;erable Wrack to our great terrour, I had in my

        Steel, and Flint to &#383;trike fire at any time upon occa&#383;ion,
        which &#383;erved now to good Purpo&#383;e, for its being &#383;o clo&#383;e,
        pre&#383;erved the Tinder dry, with this, and the help of &#383;ome old
        rotten Wood which we got together, we kindled a fire and dryed our
        &#383;elves, which done, I left my female company, and went to &#383;ee,
        if I could find any of our Ships company, that were e&#383;caped, but
        could hear of none, though I hooted, and made all the noi&#383;e I
        could; neither could I perceive the foot-&#383;teps of any living
        Creature (&#383;ave a few Birds, and other Fowls). At length it drawing
        towards the Evening, I went back to my company, who were very much
        troubled for want of me. I being now all their &#383;tay in this lo&#383;t
        condition, we were at fir&#383;t afraid that the wild people of the
        Countrey might find us out, although we &#383;aw no foot&#383;teps of
        any, not &#383;o much as a Path; the Woods round about being full of
        Briers and Brambles, we al&#383;o &#383;tood in fear of wild Bea&#383;ts,
        of &#383;uch al&#383;o we &#383;aw none, nor &#383;ign of any: But above
        all, and that we had greate&#383;t rea&#383;on to fear, was to be &#383;tarved
        to death for want of Food, but God had otherwi&#383;e provided for us,
        as you &#383;hall know hereafter; this done, we &#383;pent our time in
        getting &#383;ome broken pieces of Boards, and Planks, and &#383;ome of
        the Sails and Rigging on &#383;hore for &#383;helter; I &#383;et up two
        or three Poles, and drew two or three of the Cords and Lines from Tree
        to Tree, over which throwing &#383;ome Sail-cloathes, and having gotten
        Wood by us, and three <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p064.png">[64]</a></span>or
        four Sea-gowns, which we had dryed, we took up our Lodging for that
        night altogether (the Blackmoor being left &#383;en&#383;ible then the
        re&#383;t we made our Centry) we &#383;lept &#383;oundly that night, as
        having not &#383;lept in three or four nights before (our fears of what
        happened preventing us) neither could our hard lodging, fear, and danger
        hinder us we were &#383;o over wacht. <span class="oldnum">{{10 }}</span>

      <p>
        On the morrow, being well refre&#383;ht with &#383;leep, the winde cea&#383;ed,
        and the weather was very warm; we went down the Rocks on the &#383;ands
        at low water, where we found great part of our lading, either on shore
        or floating near it. I by the help of my company, dragged mo&#383;t of
        it on &#383;hore; what was too heavy for us broke, and we unbound the
        Casks and Cherts, and, taking out the goods, &#383;ecured all; &#383;o
        that we wanted no clothes, nor any other provi&#383;ion nece&#383;&#383;ary
        for Hou&#383;ekeeping, to furni&#383;h a better hou&#383;e than any we
        were like to have; but no victuals (the la&#383;t water having &#383;poiled
        all) only one Cask of bisket, being lighter than the re&#383;t was dry;
        this &#383;erved for bread a while, and we found on Land a &#383;ort of
        fowl about the bigne&#383;s of a Swan, very heavie and fat, that by rea&#383;on
        of their weight could not fly, of the&#383;e we found little difficulty
        to kill, &#383;o that was our pre&#383;ent food; we carried out of
        England certain Hens and Cocks to eat by the way, &#383;ome of the&#383;e
        when the &#383;hip was broken, by &#383;ome means got to land, &amp;
        bred exceedingly, &#383;o that in the future they were a great help unto
        us; we found al&#383;o, by a little River, in the flags, &#383;tore of
        eggs, of a &#383;ort of foul much like our Ducks, which were very good
        meat, &#383;o that we wanted nothing to keep us alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the morrow, which was the third day, as &#383;oon as it was morning,
        &#383;eeing nothing to di&#383;turb us, I lookt out a convenient <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p065.png">[65]</a></span>place to
        dwell in, that we might build us a Hut to &#383;helter us from the
        weather, and from any other danger of annoyance, from wild bea&#383;ts
        (if any &#383;hould finde us out: So clo&#383;e by a large &#383;pring
        which ro&#383;e out of a high hill over-looking the Sea, on the &#383;ide
        of a wood, having a pro&#383;pect towards the Sea) by the help of an Ax
        and &#383;ome other implements (for we had all nece&#383;&#383;aries,
        the working of the Sea, having ca&#383;t up mo&#383;t of our goods) I
        cut down all the &#383;traighte&#383;t poles I could find, and which
        were enough <span class="oldnum">{{11 }}</span> for my purpo&#383;e, by
        the help of my company (nece&#383;&#383;ity being our Ma&#383;ter) I
        digged holes in the earth &#383;etting my poles at an equl di&#383;tance,
        and nailing the broken boards of the Caskes, Cherts, and Cabins, and
        &#383;uch like to them, making my door to the Seaward, and having
        covered the top, with &#383;ail-clothes &#383;train'd and nail'd, I in
        the &#383;pace of a week had made a large Cabbin big enough to hold all
        our goods and our &#383;elves in it, I al&#383;o placed our Hamocks for
        lodging, purpo&#383;ing (if it plea&#383;ed God to &#383;end any Ship
        that way) we might be tran&#383;ported home, but it never came to pa&#383;s,
        the place, wherein we were (as I conceived) being much out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We having now lived in this manner full four months, and not &#383;o
        much as &#383;eeing or hearing of any wild people, or of any of our own
        company, more then our &#383;elves (they being found now by experience
        to be all drowned) and the place, as we after found, being a large I&#383;land,
        and di&#383;joyned, and out of fight of any other Land, was wholly
        uninhabited by any people, neither was there any hurtful bea&#383;t to
        annoy us: But on the contrary the countrey &#383;o very plea&#383;ant,
        being always clothed with green, and full of plea&#383;ant fruits, and
        variety of birds, ever warm, and never <span class="pagenum"><a
        href="pgimages/p066.png">[66]</a></span>colder then in England in
        September: So that this place (had it the culture, that skilful people
        might be&#383;tow on it) would prove a Paradi&#383;e.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Woods afforded us a &#383;ort of Nuts, as big as a large Apple, who&#383;e
        kernel being plea&#383;ant and dry, we made u&#383;e of in&#383;tead of
        bread, that fowl before mentioned, and a &#383;ort of water-fowl like
        Ducks, and their eggs, and a bea&#383;t about the &#383;ize of a Goat,
        and almo&#383;t &#383;uch a like creature, which brought two young ones
        at a time, and that twice a year, of which the Low Lands and Woods were
        very full, being a very harmle&#383;s creature and tame, &#383;o that we
        could ea&#383;ily <span class="oldnum">{{12 }}</span> take and kill
        them: Fi&#383;h, al&#383;o, e&#383;pecially Shell-fi&#383;h (which we
        could be&#383;t come by) we had great &#383;tore of, &#383;o that in
        effect as to Food we wanted nothing; and thus, and by &#383;uch like
        helps, we continued &#383;ix moneths without any di&#383;turbance or
        want.

      <p>
        Idlene&#383;s and Fulne&#383;s of every thing begot in me a de&#383;ire
        of enjoying the women, beginning now to grow more familiar, I had per&#383;waded
        the two Maids to let me lie with them, which I did at fir&#383;t in
        private, but after, cu&#383;tome taking away &#383;hame (there being
        none but us) we did it more openly, as our Lu&#383;ts gave us liberty;
        afterwards my Ma&#383;ters Daughter was content al&#383;o to do as we
        did; the truth is, they were all hand&#383;ome Women, when they had
        Cloathes, and well &#383;haped, feeding well. For we wanted no Food, and
        living idlely, and &#383;eeing us at Liberty to do our wills, without
        hope of ever returning home made us thus bold: One of the fir&#383;t of

        hand&#383;ome&#383;t) proved pre&#383;ently with child, the &#383;econd
        was my Ma&#383;ters Daughter, and the other al&#383;o not long <span

        into the &#383;ame condition: none now remaining but my Negro, who
        &#383;eeing what we did, longed al&#383;o for her &#383;hare; one Night,
        I being a&#383;leep, my Negro, (with the consent of the others) got clo&#383;e
        to me, thinking it being dark, to beguile me, but I awaking and feeling
        her, and perceiving who it was, yet willing to try the difference,
        &#383;atis&#383;ied my &#383;elf with her, as well as with one of the re&#383;t:
        that night, although the fir&#383;t time, she proved al&#383;o with
        child, &#383;o that in the year of our being here, all my women were
        with child by me, and they all coming at different &#383;ea&#383;ons,
        were a great help to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fir&#383;t brought me a brave Boy, my Ma&#383;ters Daughter was the
        younge&#383;t, &#383;he brought me a Girl, &#383;o did the other <span
        class="oldnum">{{13 }}</span> Maid, who being &#383;omething fat &#383;ped
        wor&#383;e at her labour: the Negro had no pain at all, brought me a
        fine white Girl, &#383;o I had one Boy and three Girls, the Women were
        &#383;oon well again, and the two fir&#383;t with child again before the
        two la&#383;t were brought to bed, my cu&#383;tome being not to lie with
        any of them after they were with child, till others were &#383;o likewi&#383;e,
        and not with the black at all after &#383;he was with child, which
        commonly was at the fir&#383;t time I lay with her, which was in the
        night and not el&#383;e, my &#383;tomach would not &#383;erve me,
        although &#383;he was one of the hand&#383;ome&#383;t Blacks I had
        &#383;een, and her children as comly as any of the re&#383;t; we had no
        clothes for them, and therefore when they had &#383;uckt, we laid them
        in Mo&#383;&#383;e to &#383;leep, and took no further care of them, for
        we knew, when they were gone more would come, the Women never failing
        once a year at lea&#383;t, and none of the Children (for all the hard&#383;hip
        we put them to) were ever &#383;ick; &#383;o that wanting now nothing
        but Cloathes, nor them much neither, other <span class="pagenum"><a
        href="pgimages/p068.png">[68]</a></span>than for decency, the warmth of
        the Countrey and Cu&#383;tome &#383;upplying that Defect, we were now
        well &#383;atis&#383;ied with our condition, our Family beginning to
        grow large, there being nothing to hurt us, we many times lay abroad on
        Mo&#383;&#383;ey Banks, under the &#383;helter of &#383;ome Trees, or
        &#383;uch like (for having nothing el&#383;e to do) I had made me &#383;everal
        Arbors to &#383;leep in with my Women in the heat of the day, in the&#383;e
        I and my women pa&#383;&#383;ed the time away, they being never willing
        to be out of my company.
      </p>
      <p>
        And having now no thought of ever returning home, as having re&#383;olved
        and &#383;worn each to other, never to part or leave one another, or the
        place; having by my &#383;everal wives, forty &#383;even Children, Boys
        and Girls, but mo&#383;t Girls, and growing up apace, we were all of us
        very fle&#383;hly, the Country &#383;o well agreeing with us, that we
        never ailed any thing; <span class="oldnum">{{14 }}</span> my Negro
        having had twelve, was the fir&#383;t that left bearing, &#383;o I never
        medled with her more: My Ma&#383;ters Daughter (by whom I had mo&#383;t
        children, being the younge&#383;t and hand&#383;ome&#383;t) was mo&#383;t
        fond of me, and I of her. Thus we lived for &#383;ixteen years, till
        perceiving my elde&#383;t Boy to mind the ordinary work of Nature, by
        &#383;eeing what we did, I gave him a Mate, and &#383;o I did to all the
        re&#383;t, as fa&#383;t as they grew up, and were capable: My Wives
        having left bearing, my children began to breed apace, &#383;o we were
        like to be a multitude; My fir&#383;t Wife brought me thirteen children,
        my &#383;econd &#383;even, my Ma&#383;ters Daughter fifteen, and the
        Negro twelve, in all forty &#383;even.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we had lived there twenty two years, my Negro died &#383;uddenly,
        but I could not perceive any thing that ailed her; mo&#383;t <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p069.png">[69]</a></span>of my
        children being grown, as fa&#383;t as we married them, I &#383;ent them
        and placed them over the River by them&#383;elves &#383;everally, becau&#383;e
        we would not pe&#383;ter one another; and now they being all grown up,
        and gone, and married after our manner (except &#383;ome two or three of
        the younge&#383;t) for (growing my &#383;elf into years) I liked not the
        wanton annoyance of young company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus having lived to the fiftieth year of my age, and the fortieth of my
        coming thither, at which time I &#383;ent for all of them to bring their
        children, and there were in number de&#383;cended from me by the&#383;e
        four Women, of my Children, Grand-children, and great Grand-children,
        five hundred &#383;ixty five of both &#383;orts, I took off the Males of
        one Family, and married them to the Females of another, not letting any
        to marry their &#383;i&#383;ters, as we did formerly out of nece&#383;&#383;ity,
        &#383;o ble&#383;&#383;ing God for his Providence and goodne&#383;s, I
        di&#383;mi&#383;t them, I having taught &#383;ome of my children to read
        formerly, for I had left &#383;till the Bible, I charged it &#383;hould
        be read once a moneth at <span class="oldnum">{{15 }}</span> a general
        meeting: At la&#383;t one of my Wives died being &#383;ixty eight years

        within a year after another, &#383;o I had none now left but my Ma&#383;ters
        Daughter, and we lived together twelve years longer, at length &#383;he
        died al&#383;o, &#383;o I buried her al&#383;o next the place where I
        purpo&#383;ed to be buried my &#383;elf, and the tall Maid my fir&#383;t
        Wife next me on the other &#383;ide, the Negro next without her, and the
        other Maid next my Ma&#383;ters Daughter. I had now nothing to mind, but
        the place whether I was to go, being very old, almo&#383;t eighty years,
        I gave my Cabin and Furniture that was left to my elde&#383;t &#383;on
        after my decea&#383;e, who had married my elde&#383;t Daughter by my
        beloved <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p070.png">[70]</a></span>Wife,
        whom I made King and Governour of all the re&#383;t: I informed them of
        the Manners of Europe, and charged them to remember the Chri&#383;tian
        Religion, after the manner of them that &#383;pake the &#383;ame
        Language, and to admit no other; if hereafter any should come and find
        them out.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now once for all, I &#383;ummoned them to come to me, that I might
        number them, which I did, and found the e&#383;timate to contain in or
        about the eightieth year of my age, and the fifty ninth of my coming
        there; in all, of all &#383;orts, one thou&#383;and &#383;even hundred
        eighty and nine. Thus praying God to multiply them, and lend them the
        true light of the Go&#383;pel, I la&#383;t of all di&#383;mi&#383;t
        them: For, being now very old, and my &#383;ight decayed, I could not
        expect to live long. I gave this Narration (written with my own hand) to
        my elde&#383;t Son, who now lived with me, commanding him to keep it,
        and if any &#383;trangers &#383;hould come hither by chance, to let them
        &#383;ee it, and take a Copy of it if they would, that our name be not
        lo&#383;t from off the earth. I gave this people (de&#383;cended from

        the reading and delivering unto us a Coppy of this Relation, then
        proceeded he on in his di&#383;cour&#383;e.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Grandfather when he wrote this, was as you hear eighty yeares of age,
        there proceeding from his Loyns one thou&#383;and &#383;even hundred
        eighty nine children, which he had by them four women afore&#383;aid: My
        Father was his elde&#383;t &#383;on, and was named Henry, begotten of
        his wife Mary Sparkes, whom he apointed chief Governour and Ruler over
        the re&#383;t; and having given him a charge not to exerci&#383;e
        tyranny over them, &#383;eeing they were his fellow brethren by Fathers
        &#383;ide (of which there could be no doubt made of double dealing
        therein) exhorting him to u&#383;e ju&#383;tice and &#383;incerity among&#383;t
        them, and not to let Religion die with him, but to ob&#383;erve and keep
        tho&#383;e Precepts which he had taught them, he quietly &#383;urrendred
        up his &#383;oul, and was buried with great lamentation of all his
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        My father coming to rule, and the people growing more populous, made
        them to range further in the di&#383;covery of the Countrey, which they
        found an&#383;werable to their de&#383;ires, full both of Fowls and Bea&#383;ts,
        and tho&#383;e too not hurtful to mankinde, as if this Country (on which
        we were by providence ca&#383;t without arms or other weapons to defend
        our &#383;elves, or offend others,) &#383;hould by the &#383;ame
        providence be &#383;o inhabited as not to have any need of &#383;uch
        like weapons of de&#383;truction wherewith to pre&#383;erve our lives.

        But as it is impo&#383;&#383;ible, but that in multitudes di&#383;orders
        will grow, the &#383;tronger &#383;eeking to oppre&#383;s the weaker; no
        tye of Religion being &#383;trong enough to chain up the depraved nature
        of mankinde, even &#383;o among&#383;t them mi&#383;chiefs began to ri&#383;e,
        and they <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p072.png">[72]</a></span>&#383;oon
        fell from tho&#383;e good orders pre&#383;cribed them by my Grandfather.
        The &#383;ource from whence tho&#383;e mi&#383;chiefs &#383;pring, was
        at fir&#383;t, I conceive, the neglect of hearing the Bible read, which
        according to my Grandfathers pro&#383;cription, was once a moneth at a
        general meeting, but now many of them wandring far up into the Country,
        they quite neglected the coming to it, with all other means of Chri&#383;tian
        in&#383;truction, whereby the &#383;ence of &#383;in being quite lo&#383;t
        in them, they fell to whoredoms, ince&#383;ts, and adulteries; &#383;o
        that what my Grandfather was forced to do for nece&#383;&#383;ity, they
        did for wantonne&#383;s; nay not confining them&#383;elves within the
        bound of any mode&#383;ty, but brother and &#383;i&#383;ter lay openly
        together; tho&#383;e who would not yield to their lewd embraces, were by
        force ravished, yea many times endangered of their lives. To redre&#383;s
        tho&#383;e enormities, my father a&#383;&#383;embled all the Company
        near unto him, to whom he declared the wickedne&#383;s of tho&#383;e
        their brethren; who all with one con&#383;ent agreed that they &#383;hould
        be &#383;everely puni&#383;hed; and &#383;o arming them&#383;elves with
        boughs, &#383;tones, and &#383;uch like weapons, they marched again&#383;t
        them, who having notice of their coming, and fearing their de&#383;erved
        puni&#383;hment, &#383;ome of them fled into woods, others pa&#383;&#383;ed
        over a great River, which runneth through the heart of our Countrey,
        hazarding drowning to e&#383;cape puni&#383;hment; But the grande&#383;t
        offender of them all was taken, whole name was John Phill, the &#383;econd

      </p>
      <p>
        1. That who&#383;oever &#383;hould bla&#383;pheme or talk irreverently
        of the name of God &#383;hould be put to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. That who &#383;hould be ab&#383;ent from the monethly a&#383;&#383;embly
        to hear the Bible read, without &#383;ufficient cau&#383;e &#383;hown to
        the contrary, &#383;hould for the fir&#383;t default be kept without any
        victuals or drink, for the &#383;pace of four days, and if he offend
        therein again, then to &#383;uffer death.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. That who should force or ravi&#383;h any Maid or Woman should be
        burnt to death, the party &#383;o ravi&#383;hed putting fire to the wood
        that should burn him.

        4. Who&#383;oever shall commit adultery, for the fir&#383;t crime the
        Male shall lo&#383;e his Privities, and the Woman have her right eye
        bored out, if after that she was again taken in the act, she should die
        without mercy.
      </p>
      <p>

        Neighbour, to become &#383;ervant to him, whil&#383;t he had made him
        double &#383;ati&#383;faction.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. That, who should defame or &#383;peak evil of the Governour, or refu&#383;e
        to come before him upon Summons, &#383;hould receive a puni&#383;hment
        by whipping with Rods, and afterwards be exploded from the &#383;ociety
        of the re&#383;t of the inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having &#383;et forth the&#383;e Laws, he cho&#383;e four &#383;everal
        per&#383;ons under him to &#383;ee them put in Execution, whereof one
        was of the Engli&#383;hes, the Off-&#383;pring of Sarah Engli&#383;h;
        another of his own Tribe, the Sparks; a third of the Trevors, and the
        fourth of the Phills, appointing them every year at a certain time to

        The Countrey being thus &#383;ettled, my father lived quiet and
        peaceable till he attained to the age of ninety and four years, when
        dying, I &#383;ucceeded in his place, in which I have continued

        any thing which lay in our powers, wherewith we could plea&#383;ure him
        in what he &#383;hould de&#383;ire, and thereupon preferred to depart,
        but before our going away, he would needs engage us to &#383;ee him, the
        next day, when was to be their great a&#383;&#383;embly or monethly
        meeting for the celebration of their Religious Exerci&#383;es.

        Accordingly the next day we came thither again, and were courteou&#383;ly
        entertained as before, In a &#383;hort &#383;pace there was gathered
        &#383;uch a multitude of people together as made us to <span

        href="pgimages/p075.png">[75]</a></span>and fir&#383;t there were &#383;everal
        Weddings celebrated, the manner whereof was thus. The Bridegroom and
        Bride appeared before him who was their Prie&#383;t or Reader of the
        Bible, together with the Parents of each party, or if any of their
        Parents were dead, then the next relation unto them, without who&#383;e
        con&#383;ent as well as the parties to be married, the Prie&#383;t will
        not joyn them together; but being &#383;atis&#383;ied in tho&#383;e
        particulars, after &#383;ome &#383;hort Oraizons, and joyning of hands
        together, he pronounces them to be man and wife: and with exhortations
        to them to live lovingly towards each other, and quietly towards their
        neighbors, he concludes with &#383;ome prayers, and &#383;o di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;es
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Weddings being fini&#383;hed, all the people took their places to
        hear the Word read, the new married per&#383;ons having the honour to be
        next unto the Prie&#383;t that day, after he had read three or four
        Chapters he fell to expounding the mo&#383;t difficult places therein,
        the people being very attentive all that while, this exerci&#383;e
        continued for two or three hours, which being done, with &#383;ome few
        prayers he concluded, but all the re&#383;t of that day was by the
        people kept very &#383;trictly, ab&#383;taining from all manner of
        playing or pa&#383;times, with which on other dayes they u&#383;e to pa&#383;s
        their time away, as having need of nothing but victuals, and that they
        have in &#383;uch plenty as almo&#383;t provided to their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their exerci&#383;es of Religion being over, we returned again to our
        Ship, and the next day, taking with us two or three Fowling-pieces
        leaving half our Company to guard the Ship, the re&#383;t of us re&#383;olved
        to go up higher into the Country for a further di&#383;covery: All the
        way as we pa&#383;&#383;ed the fir&#383;t morning, we &#383;aw abundance
        of little Cabbins or Huts of the&#383;e inhabitants, made under <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p076.png">[76]</a></span>Trees, and fa&#383;hioned
        up with boughs, gra&#383;s, <span class="oldnum">{{21 }}</span> and
        &#383;uch like &#383;tuffe to defend them from the Sun and Rain; and as
        we went along, they came out of them much wondering at our Attire, and
        &#383;tanding aloof off from us as if they were afraid, but our
        companion that &#383;pake English, calling to them in their own Tongue,
        and giving them good words, they drew nigher, &#383;ome of them freely
        proffering to go along with us, which we willingly accepted; but having
        pa&#383;&#383;ed &#383;ome few miles, one of our company e&#383;pying a
        Bea&#383;t like unto a Goat come gazing on him, he di&#383;charged his
        Peece, &#383;ending a brace of Bullets into his belly, which brought him
        dead upon the ground; these poor naked unarmed people hearing the noi&#383;e
        of the Peece, and &#383;eeing the Bea&#383;t lie tumbling in his gore,
        without &#383;peaking any words betook them to their heels, running back
        again as fast as they could drive, nor could the per&#383;wa&#383;ions
        of our Company, a&#383;&#383;uring them they &#383;hould have no hurt,
        prevail anything at all with them, &#383;o that we were forced to pa&#383;s
        along without their company: all the way that we went we heard the
        delightful harmony of &#383;inging Birds, the ground very fertile in
        Trees, Gra&#383;s, and &#383;uch flowers, as grow by the production of
        Nature, without the help of Art; many and &#383;everal &#383;orts of
        Beads we &#383;aw, who were not &#383;o much wild as in other Countries;
        whether it were as having enough to &#383;atiate them&#383;elves without
        ravening upon others, or that they never before &#383;aw the &#383;ight
        of man, nor heard the report of murdering Guns, I leave it to others to
        determine. Some Trees bearing wild Fruits we al&#383;o &#383;aw, and of
        tho&#383;e &#383;ome whereof we tailed, which were neither unwhol&#383;ome
        nor di&#383;ta&#383;teful to the Pallate, and no que&#383;tion had but
        Nature here the benefit of Art added unto <span class="pagenum"><a
        href="pgimages/p077.png">[77]</a></span>it, it would equal, if not
        exceed many of our European Countries; the Vallyes were every where
        intermixt with running &#383;treams, and no que&#383;tion but the earth
        <span class="oldnum">{{22 }}</span> hath in it rich veins of Minerals,
        enough to &#383;ati&#383;fie the de&#383;ires of the mo&#383;t covetous.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was very &#383;trange to us, to &#383;ee that in &#383;uch a fertile
        Countrey which was as yet never inhabited, there &#383;hould be notwith&#383;tanding
        &#383;uch a free and clear pa&#383;&#383;age to us, without the
        hinderance of Bu&#383;hes, Thorns, and &#383;uch like fluff, wherewith
        mo&#383;t I&#383;lands of the like nature are pe&#383;tered: the length
        of the Gra&#383;s (which yet was very much intermixt with flowers) being
        the only impediment that we found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six dayes together did we thus travel, &#383;etting &#383;everal marks
        in our way as we went for our better return, not knowing whether we
        &#383;hould have the benefit of the Stars for our guidance in our going
        back, which we made u&#383;e of in our pa&#383;&#383;age: at la&#383;t
        we came to the va&#383;t Ocean on the other &#383;ide of the I&#383;land,
        and by our coa&#383;ting it, conceive it to be of an oval form, only
        here and there &#383;hooting forth with &#383;ome Promontories. I
        conceive it hath but few good Harbours belonging to it, the Rocks in mo&#383;t
        places making it inacce&#383;&#383;ible. The length of it may be about
        two hundred, and the breadth one hundred miles, the whole in
        circumference about five hundred miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        It lyeth about &#383;eventy &#383;ix degrees of Longitude, and twenty of
        Latitude, being &#383;cituate under the third Climate, the longe&#383;t
        day being about thirteen hours and fourty five minutes. The weather, as
        in all Southern Countries, is far more hot than with us in Europe; but
        what is by the Sun parched in the day, the night again refre&#383;hes
        with cool pearly dews. The Air is found to <span class="pagenum"><a
        href="pgimages/p078.png">[78]</a></span>be very healthful by the long
        lives <span class="oldnum">{{23 }}</span> of the pre&#383;ent
        inhabitants, few dying there till &#383;uch time as they come to good
        years of maturity, many of them arriving to the extremity of old age.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now &#383;peaking concerning the length of their Lives, I think it
        will not be ami&#383;&#383;e in this place to &#383;peak &#383;omething
        of their Burials, which they u&#383;ed to do thus.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the party was dead, they &#383;tuck his Carka&#383;s all over with
        flowers, and after carried him to the place appointed for Burial, where
        &#383;etting him down, (the Prie&#383;t having given &#383;ome godly
        Exhortations concerning the frailty of life) then do they take &#383;tones
        (a heap being provided there for that purpo&#383;e) and the neare&#383;t
        of the kin begins to lay the fir&#383;t &#383;tone upon him, afterwards
        the re&#383;t follows, they never leaving till they have covered the
        body deep in &#383;tones, &#383;o that no Bea&#383;t can po&#383;&#383;ibly
        come to him, and this fir&#383;t were they forced to make, having no
        Spades or Shovels wherewith to dig them Graves; which want of theirs we
        e&#383;pying, be&#383;towed a Pick-ax and two Shovels upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here might I add their way of Chri&#383;tening Children, but that being
        little different from yours in ENGLAND, and taught them by GEORGE PINES
        at fir&#383;t which they have &#383;ince continued, I &#383;hall
        therefore forbear to &#383;peak thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        After our return back from the di&#383;covery of the Countrey, the Wind
        not being fit for our purpo&#383;e, and our men al&#383;o willing
        thereto, we got all our cutting In&#383;truments on Land, and <span
        class="oldnum">{{24 }}</span> fell to hewing down of Trees, with which,
        in a little time,(many hands making light work) we built up a Pallace
        for this William Pines the Lord of that Countrey; which, though much
        inferiour to the hou&#383;es of your Gentry in England. Yet to them
        which <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p079.png">[79]</a></span>never
        had &#383;een better, it appeared a very Lordly Place. This deed of ours
        was beyond expre&#383;&#383;ion acceptable unto him, load-ing us with
        thanks for &#383;o great a benefit, of which he &#383;aid he &#383;hould
        never be able to make a requital.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now acquainting him, that upon the fir&#383;t opportunity we were re&#383;olved
        to leave the I&#383;land, as al&#383;o how that we were near Neighbours
        to the Countrey of England, from whence his Ance&#383;tors came; he
        &#383;eemed upon the news to be much di&#383;contented that we would
        leave him, de&#383;iring, if it might &#383;tand with our commodity to
        continue &#383;till with him, but &#383;eeing he could not prevail, he
        invited us to dine with him the next day, which we promi&#383;ed to do,
        again&#383;t which time he provided, very &#383;umptuou&#383;ly
        (according to his e&#383;tate) for us, and now was he attended after a
        more Royal manner than ever we &#383;aw him before, both for number of
        Servants, and multiplicity of Meat, on which we fed very heartily; but
        he having no other Beverage for us to drink, then water, we fetched from
        our Ship a Ca&#383;e of Brandy, pre&#383;enting &#383;ome of it to him
        to drink, but when he had ta&#383;ted of it, he would by no means be per&#383;waded
        to touch thereof again, preferring (as he &#383;aid) his own Countrey
        Water before all &#383;uch Liquors what&#383;oever.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we had Dined, we were invited out into the Fields to behold their
        Country Dauncing, which they did with great agility of body; and though
        they had no other then only <span class="oldnum">{{25 }}</span> Vocal Mu&#383;ick
        (&#383;everal of them &#383;inging all that while) yet did they trip it
        very neatly, giving &#383;ufficient &#383;ati&#383;faction to all that
        beheld them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day we invited the Prince William Pines aboard our <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p080.png">[80]</a></span>Ship, where
        was nothing wanting in what we could to entertain him, he had about a
        dozen of Servants to attend on him he much admired at the Tacklings of
        our Ship, but when we came to di&#383;charge a piece or two of Ordnance,
        it struck him into a wonder and amazement to behold the &#383;trange
        effects of Powder; he was very &#383;paring in his Diet, neither could
        he, or any of his followers be induced to drink any thing but Water: We
        there pre&#383;ented him with &#383;everal things, as much as we could
        &#383;pare, which we thought would any wayes conduce to their benefit,
        all which he very gratefully received, a&#383;&#383;uring us of his real
        love and good will, when&#383;oever we &#383;hould come thither again.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now we intended the next day to take our leaves, the Wind &#383;tanding
        fair, blowing with a gentle Gale South and by Ea&#383;t, but as we were
        hoi&#383;ting of our Sails, and weighing Anchor, we were &#383;uddenly
        Allarm'd with a noi&#383;e from the &#383;hore, the Prince, W. Pines
        imploring our a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance in an In&#383;urection which had
        happened among&#383;t them, of which this was the cau&#383;e.
      </p>
      <p>
        Henry Phil, the chief Ruler of the Tribe or Family of the Phils, being
        the Off&#383;pring of George Pines which he had by the Negro-woman; this
        man had ravi&#383;hed the Wife of one of the principal of the Family of
        the Trevors, which act being made known, the Trevors a&#383;&#383;embled
        them&#383;elves all together to bring the offender unto Ju&#383;tice:
        But he knowing his crime to be &#383;o great, as extended to the lo&#383;s
        of life: fought to defend that <span class="oldnum">{{26 }}</span> by
        force, which he had as unlawfully committed, whereupon the whole I&#383;land
        was in a great hurly burly, they being too great Potent Factions, the
        bandying of which again&#383;t each other, threatned a general ruin to
        the whole State.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p081.png">[81]</a></span>The
        Governour William Pines had interpo&#383;ed in the matter, but found his
        Authority too weak to repre&#383;s &#383;uch Di&#383;orders; for where
        the Hedge of Government is once broken down, the mo&#383;t vile bear the
        greate&#383;t rule, whereupon he de&#383;ired our a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance,
        to which we readily conde&#383;cended, and arming out twelve of us went
        on Shore, rather as to a &#383;urprize than fight, for what could
        nakedne&#383;s do to encounter with Arms. Being conducted by him to the
        force of our Enemy, we fir&#383;t entered into parley, &#383;eeking to
        gain them rather by fair means then force, but that not prevailing, we
        were nece&#383;itated to u&#383;e violence, for this Henry Phill being
        of an undaunted re&#383;olution, and having armed his fellows with Clubs
        and Stones, they &#383;ent &#383;uch a Peal among&#383;t us, as made us
        at the fir&#383;t to give back, which encouraged them to follow us on
        with great violence, but we di&#383;charging off three or four Guns,
        when they &#383;aw &#383;ome of them&#383;elves wounded, and heard the
        terrible reports which they gave, they ran away with greater &#383;peed
        then they came. The Band of the Trevors who were joyned with us, hotly
        pur&#383;ued them, and having taken their Captain, returned with great
        triumph to their Governour, who fitting in Judgment upon him, he was
        adjudged to death, and thrown off a &#383;teep Rock into the Sea, the
        only way they have of puni&#383;hing any by death, except burning.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now at la&#383;t we took our &#383;olemn leaves of the Governour,
        and departed from thence, having been there in all, the &#383;pace of
        three weeks and two dayes, we took with us good &#383;tore of the fle&#383;h
        of a Bea&#383;t which they call there Reval, being <span class="oldnum">{{27
        }}</span> in ta&#383;te different either from Beef or Swines-fle&#383;h,
        yet very delightful to the Pallate, and exceeding nutrimental. We took
        al&#383;o with us alive, <span class="pagenum"><a
        href="pgimages/p082.png">[82]</a></span>divers Fowls which they call
        Marde, about the bigne&#383;s of a Pullet, and not different in ta&#383;te,
        they are very &#383;wift of flight, and yet &#383;o fearle&#383;s of
        danger, that they will &#383;tand &#383;till till &#383;uch time as you
        catch them: We had al&#383;o &#383;ent us in by the Governour about two
        bu&#383;hels of eggs, which as I conjecture were the Mards eggs, very lu&#383;ious
        in ta&#383;te, and &#383;trenthening to the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        June 8. We had a &#383;ight of Cambaia, a part of the Ea&#383;t Indies,
        but; under the Government of the great Cham of Tartary here our Ve&#383;&#383;el
        &#383;pringing a leak, we were forced to put to Chore, receiving much
        dammage in &#383;ome of our Commodities; we were forced to ply the Pump
        for eighteen hours together, which, had that mi&#383;carried, we had
        inevitably have peri&#383;hed; here we &#383;tai'd five dayes mending
        our Ship, and drying &#383;ome of our Goodss and then hoi&#383;ting
        Sail, in four days time more we came to Calecute.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Calecute is the chief Mart Town and Staple of all the Indian
        Traffique, it is very populous, and frequented by Merchants of all
        Nations. Here we unladed a great part of our Goods, and taking in
        others, which cau&#383;ed us to &#383;tay there a full Moneth, during
        which &#383;pace, at lei&#383;ure times I went abroad to take a &#383;urvey
        of the City, which I found to be large and populous, lying for three
        miles together upon the Sea-shore. Here is a great many of tho&#383;e
        per&#383;ons whom thy call Brackmans, being their Prie&#383;ts or
        Teachers whom they much reverence. It is a cu&#383;tome here for the
        King to give to &#383;ome of tho&#383;e Brachmain, the handelling of his
        Nuptial Bed; for which cau&#383;e, not the Kings, but the Kings &#383;isters
        &#383;ons &#383;ucceed in the Kingdom, as being more certainly known to
        be of the true Royal blood: And the&#383;e &#383;isters of his choo&#383;e
        what Gentleman they <span class="oldnum">{{28 }}</span> plea&#383;e
        <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p083.png">[83]</a></span>on whom
        to be&#383;tow their Virginities; and if they prove not in a certain
        time to be with child, they betake them&#383;elves to the&#383;e <i>Brachman
        Stalions</i>, who never fail of doing their work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people are indifferently civil and ingenious, both men and women
        imitate a Maje&#383;ty in their Train and Apparel, which they &#383;weeten,
        with Oyles and Perfumes: adorning them&#383;elves with Jewels and other
        Ornaments befitting each Rank and Quality of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have many odd Cu&#383;toms among&#383;t them which they observe
        very &#383;trictly; as fir&#383;t, not knowing their Wives after they
        have born them two children: Secondly, not accompanying them, if after
        five years cohabition they can rai&#383;e no i&#383;&#383;ue by them,
        but taking others in their rooms: Thirdly, never being rewarded for any
        Military exploit, unle&#383;s they bring with them an enemies Head in
        their Hand, but that which is &#383;trange&#383;t, and indeed mo&#383;t
        barbarous, is that when any of their friends falls &#383;ick, they will
        rather chu&#383;e to kill him, then that he &#383;hould be withered by
        &#383;ickne&#383;s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus you &#383;ee there is little employment there for Doctors, when to
        be &#383;ick, is the next wan for to be &#383;lain, or perhaps the
        people may be of the mind rather to kill them&#383;elves, then to let
        the Doctors do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having di&#383;patched our bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and &#383;raighted again
        our Ship, we left Calecute, and put forth to Sea, and coa&#383;ted along
        several of the I&#383;lands belonging to India, at Camboia I met with
        our old friend Mr. David Prire, who was overjoyed to &#383;ee me, to
        whom I related our Di&#383;covery of the I&#383;land of Pines, in the
        &#383;ame manner as I have related it to you; he was then but newly
        recovered <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p084.png">[84]</a></span>of
        a Feaver, the Air of that place not being agreeable to him; here we took
        in good &#383;tore of Aloes, and &#383;ome other Commodities, and
        victualled our Ship for our return home. <span class="oldnum">{{29 }}</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        After four dayes failing we met with two Portugal Ships which came from
        Lisbon, one whereof had in a &#383;torm lo&#383;t its Top-ma&#383;t, and
        was forced in part to be towed by the other. We had no bad weather in
        eleven dayes &#383;pace, but then a &#383;udden &#383;torm of Wind did
        us much harm in our Tacklings, and &#383;wept away one of our Sailors
        off from the Fore Ca&#383;tle. November the &#383;ixth had like to have
        been a fatal day unto us, our Ship &#383;triking twice upon a Rock, and
        at night was in danger of being fired by the negligence of a Boy,
        leaving a Candle carele&#383;ly in the Gun-room; the next day we were
        chafed by a Pyrate Argiere, but by the &#383;wiftne&#383;s of our Sails
        we out ran him. December the fir&#383;t we came again to Madaga&#383;car,
        where we put in for a fre&#383;h recruit of Victuals and Water.
      </p>
      <p>
        During our abode here, there hapned a very great Earthquake, which
        tumbled down many Hou&#383;es; The people of them&#383;elves are very
        Unho&#383;pitable and Treacherous, hardly to to be drawn to Traffique
        with any people; and now, this calamitie happening upon them, &#383;o
        enraged them again&#383;t the Chri&#383;tians, imputing all luch
        calamities to the cau&#383;e of them, that they fell upon &#383;ome
        Portugais and wounded them, and we &#383;eeing their mi&#383;chievous
        Actions, with all the &#383;peed we could put forth to Sea again, and
        &#383;ailed to the Island of St. Hellens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we &#383;tayed all the Chri&#383;mas Holy-dayes, which was vere
        much celebrated by the Governour there under the King of Spain. Here we
        furni&#383;hed our&#383;elves with all nece&#383;&#383;aries which <span
        class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p085.png">[85]</a></span>we wanted;
        but upon our departure, our old acquaintance Mr. Petrus Ramazina, coming
        in a Skiff out of the I&#383;le del Principe, or the Princes I&#383;land,
        retarded our going for the &#383;pace of two dayes, for both my &#383;elf
        and our Pur&#383;er had Emergent bu&#383;ine&#383;s with him, he being
        concerned in tho&#383;e Affairs of which I wrote to you in April la&#383;t:
        Indeed we cannot but <span class="oldnum">{{30 }}</span> acknowledge his
        Courte&#383;ies unto us, of which you know he is never &#383;paring.
        January the fir&#383;t, we again hoi&#383;ted Sail, having a fair and
        pro&#383;perous gail of Wind, we touched at the Canaries, but made no
        tarriance, de&#383;irous now to &#383;ee our Native Countrey; but the
        Winds was very cro&#383;s unto us for the &#383;pace of a week, at la&#383;t
        we were &#383;avoured with a gentle Gale, which brought us on merrily;
        though we were on a &#383;udden &#383;tricken again into a dump; a
        Sailor from the main Ma&#383;t di&#383;covering five Ships, which put us
        all in a great fear, we being Richly Laden, and not very well provided
        for Defence; but they bearing up to us, we found them to be Zealanders
        and our Friends; after many other pa&#383;&#383;ages concerning us, not
        &#383;o much worthy of Note, we at la&#383;t &#383;afele arrived at
        home, May 26. 1668.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus Sir, have I given you a brief, but true Relation of our Voyage,
        Which I was the more willing to do, to prevent fal&#383;e Copies which
        might be &#383;pread of this nature: As for the I&#383;land of Pines it
        &#383;elf, which cau&#383;ed me to Write this Relation, I &#383;uppo&#383;e
        it is a thing &#383;o &#383;trange as will hardly be credited by &#383;ome,

        our la&#383;t age being &#383;o full of Discoveries, that this Place
        &#383;hould lie Dormant for &#383;o long a &#383;pace of time; Others I

        &#383;o hateful to divulge Fal&#383;ities; I &#383;hall reque&#383;t you

        POST-SCRIPT:
      </h3>
      <p>
        ONE thing concerning the I&#383;le of Pines, I had almo&#383;t quite
        forgot, we had with us an Iri&#383;h man named Dermot Conelly who had
        formerly been in England, and had learned there to play on the
        Bag-pipes, which he carried to Sea with him; yet &#383;o un-Engli&#383;hed
        he was, that he had quite forgotten your Language, but &#383;till
        retained his Art of Bagpipe-playing, in which he took extraordinary
        delight; being one day on Land in the I&#383;le of Pines, he played on
        them, but to &#383;ee the admiration of tho&#383;e naked people
        concerning them, would have &#383;triken you into admiration; long time
        it was before we could per&#383;wade them that it was not a living
        creature, although they were permitted to touch and feel it, and yet are
        the people very intelligible, retaining a great part of the Ingenuity
        and Gallantry of the Engli&#383;h Nation, though they have not that
        happy means to expre&#383;s them&#383;elves; in this re&#383;pect we may
        account them fortunate, in that po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing little,
        they enjoy all things, as being contented with what they have, wanting
        tho&#383;e alurements to mi&#383;chief, which our European Countries are
        enriched with. I &#383;hall not dilate any further, no que&#383;tion but
        time will make this I&#383;land known better to the world; all that I
        &#383;hall ever &#383;ay of it is, that it is a place enriched with
        Natures abundance, deficient in nothing conducible to the &#383;u&#383;tentation
        of mans life, which were it Manured by Agriculture and Gardening, as
        other of our European Countries are, no que&#383;tion but it would
        equal, if not exceed many which now pa&#383;s for prai&#383;eworthy.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
